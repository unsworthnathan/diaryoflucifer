The Diary of Lucifer
by Lucifer







	Now the whole of all the scriptures written that are not to be added to the Bible, are given to Nathan Unsworth, being the businessman who is given ownership of all the scriptures that he is given The Diary of Lucifer and Notes from Salem and this book as well, that they are his entirely, him being an artist and businessman entrusted with these things, that he did not pay for them but was given them freely, than this is a man who is polish in ethnicity, being entirely polish, who is given all the scriptures of the Emperor of Salem, who is the angel, and all the scriptures of the angel. Now the businessman's name is Nathan Brian Barrie Unsworth, born in Edmonton, Alberta, student of Humber College, citizen of Canada, son of an Unsworth and Barrie, student of Cayuga Secondary School, resident of Hannah, Selkirk, Haldimand-Norfolk, Calgary, Toronto, and Hamilton all in Ontario except for Calgary and Hannah, Alberta. Now the prior is the order of his residences, that he was a child in Hannah, and moved to Ontario at approximately the age of five. His email address is unsworthnathan@gmail.com. He does not support or condone nor condemn any of the writings in The Diary of Lucifer, Notes from Salem, or this book called The Other World.



Introduction: Much of the text concerns Babylon and the need for it to be destroyed but this is not the only consideration, for the writing of proverbs is endless and yet never satisfied, and more wisdom is moving towards what is better. The existence of the Elsnon and Enoch is of particular concern to me as well as the restoration of society and the advancement of society, essentially, the purging of foolish lies that hinder a better existence where better things can be taken for granted, is another concern that can be found in the proverbs. That the proverbs do not condemn any other religion should not be surprising, for I have not intended to bring war against another religion, or another nation and wish for truth and reason when approaching such things. The religion of the proverbs is Christianity, and The New Testiment, as well as the Old Testiment, is required to understand some of the proverbs. Islam is not condemned or attacked, and I would be pleased if more would consider the tremendous problems of Babylon and its emergences on Earth when weighing the desire for disparaging another religion, since the proverbs are not designed to serve as a catalyst for disparagement of Islam, and I am of the belief that many people groups are to be praised for the good qualities that they possess.





{The Long Proverbs and Short Proverbs of Lucifer}


Now the standard quality of a person was at least a person is trying to do what is good and moral, although much has moved beyond that, so that it is as if there is no more time for such things.

I have heard the story of Martha, and how she cooked the meal that the Judeo-Christian son of God ate with his disciples, and how her older sister cleaned the house, and have produced the proverb of mine that, Martha takes the cake, but she did not bake it. So is the existence of those who understand and have no time for the monotonous waiting and wasteful diligence of those who must prove something by means other than simply understanding and knowing what the truth is, and so we have come to the modern technocracy that is not like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World but is more connected with a form of anarchy and strange thefts that occur where ideas are stolen, or credit is claimed by others, and even awards ignore those who understood far in advance and offered exact answers and directions before the person awarded and credited moved to take what was not made by them, the cake, to then claim no knowledge that they had ever known of who came prior to them, or who invented, understood, and offered the answers, and if it should then be understood by others, the person who offers the 'theory' indeed understands the theory they offer, even to the point of knowledge, and is not merely being impossibly lucky, of course, which would be mathematically impossible, but of course that would go without saying, as is our English expression, in which this collection of mine, my book of theories, or hypothesis, was originally written, in the only language I understand at the time, being the English language, in which I have also written a number of fiction books that also contain many of my theories that are not to be featured in this book, which I imagine will be shorter. I have believed in truth to be found in almost every religion, and if my understanding is correct, I was such a type in my youth as to be shunned by moralizing like-women men on many occassions for what I can only assume are religious reasons, rooted in Christianity, which I ignored, and a reading of the New Testiment might offer some guidance on that subject, only that many seemed to talk about me behind my back, but would not say such things when I was around, the males, at least, and such was my youth, and the type of person I was, a lover of some type, a person interested in computers, a slacker in school, a person who played two musical instruments, a good student later, when I realized the consequences of not studying, and a person who liked to figure things out for myself, ignoring much of what I had been taught, while accepting most of it after I had decided it was right. Given the type of person I am, I had to deal with a type of Christian men when I was younger, sometimes shunning me, and most of them accepting me, and treating me well, and now I must worry about domestic terrorists who seem to be against what I am, so that I can only wonder about North America and whether the RCMP or the FBI can protect us, in ernest, or if we have entered into a floating cloud, a microcosm of dark ages where pockets of terrorism seem to float about my own country, especially, it would seem, during the COVID crises, but even prior to that, and I have wondered about the American Dream, or the North American dream in many ways, and whether it can survive without a boost of funding and resources to law enforcement and federal agencies at a time when domestic terrorism is seeming to become more prevaliant and more violent, especially following the Me Too Movement after which time I personally found myself facing new amounts of unanticipated and unacceptable problems I could not attribute to anything other than the idea that some people believed I was Lucifer, Satan, the Anti-Christ, until I became more educated on domestic terrorism and the problems of a corrupt city where many people seemed to have lost out on the North American dream and the crime rate was high, which has been an influence upon my considerations of North America and the world, and even helped me to value and take for granted more my rights and freedoms in North America, which I believe are not objects for compromise or debate, but are a given to me, to be defended and taken for granted, with gratitude towards those who stand on a wall, prepared to do what must be done, justly and rightly, to protect me. The city I currently reside in has been called both 'little Toronto' and 'little Detroit' but in honesty it is probably more like 'little Chicago' with many aspects to the city and divided into two parts, the more disenfranchised usually residing in the part where the likelyhood of terrorism seems greater. An person who does not easily dispair, perhaps, I have hope for the future, and believe that the North American Dream will survive, but I have come to believe that a stronger support is required to get control of a country that expects to take for granted the basic freedoms and opportunities we have come to expect for every citizen, whether there is the existence of domestic terrorists or not.

Conciousness, and its levels, and the substantial principles of individuals who are on different levels of conciousness, and the requirement for seperation amongst these groups in some cases when groups on different levels of conciousness cannot exist together, and what the beliefs are for those different groups and what they might understand, and what is required of them, and what different morally, even, they might have, and whether there is any contradiction in morality for other groups, or none, and whether the addition of morality is higher, or sometimes lower, and the finite limitations for variation among groups, based on finite psychology of the nature of humanity, and of course what we are, and not requiring an explanation of origins to arrive at the truth of our present and even our future. The truth then being discovered at different levels, and sometimes not-accessible to some that some might find access to more truth in other areas, and the idea that the truth is then capable of entertaining the whole of humanity, and that there is always more that we do not know, and then there is what might not be perceptible by any human alive, or who will ever live, until a new sentience of humans might emerge. What type of people hold humanity back, are of course those who are not able to tolerate the explorations of others, and these I will place in one category, calling them the Anti-progress sociopaths in our society, not using the term sociopath to refer to the psychological disorder of psychopathy but in my own fashion, meaning anti-social individuals in society, who I believe should not be considered to have the level of 'place' in our society, since they are truly against society in their actions and against the enjoyment of the majority in our society. What religion an Anti-progress sociopath inhabits does not matter, since I do not include religion, but only view religions to be catalysts and vehicles for anti-progress sociopaths to use, and possibly use wrongly, like using a self-defence weapon for murder, or for some purpose that was not intended by the invention. What are the real groups and the real categories? How does our language, the common words we use, lie to us, or distract us from the truth, and what concepts have been introduced that distract us from the truth or lie to us? If psychology contains sociology, than there is perhaps no more use, at least for me, in any half-blind social experiment that only afflicts the inflexible and finite humans who cannot adapt beyond limits to a  theory about society, or some other item, that cannot be practical in society, or truth. The presence of wrong collections, or paradigms that are to be posited and not discovered offers us only a bad path to journey down that will not be benificial at some later time and the chaos of humanity, especially when dealing with dissatisfaction, seems to suggest that deviation from any better system will occur, whether to become more beneficial or less beneficial. What then should be offered? The idea of dismissing wrong catogorization of many things in society becomes necessary and the invention of new words is required to re-catagorize and discover those things that are Universally true, regardless of the fluxuations of the system they are in. There is no attempt then to surmount any sociology or psychology, but only to offer theories, hypothetical theories, that might supply answers for future generations, and that will hopefully survive the test of time, however wrong that concept might be in practicality when we consider the arrogance of all that we now know, and how little we truly understand our present time due to all the information we are not given about what we are doing in the world and our inability to recognize what we are doing in comparison to the past, where we are today committing evils that were far lesser hundreds of years prior, or thousands of years prior, or have thrown away evils that were worse hundreds of years prior, or thousands of years prior. Even then we had the anti-progress sociopath who was masquarading as an intellectual, or masquarading as a religious figure, or something else, and even then there was the self-affirming sociopath who gives themselves permission when they are aware and might even admit, they do not stand on substance, but on the concept of relying on a tradition in society that was never intended to contend with science of any type or with the truth of humanity and its finite capacity, or limits. Lack of vocabulary can be a problem, but more of a problem is the lack of the variafiably correct paradigms to explain our society, and there we rely on sociology and psychology that is not to be tampered with by any ideology that might be considered political, or only wanted by a group, since the truth can provide the answer, the social justice, that is required for any person, when there is really an injustice that must be addressed. Attempts by the wrong hand only provide a sense of persecution for others and an undesirable effect later on for every person, whereas the correct hand uses the truth to the extent it is required and offers the correct solution that will provide social justice for every person. The amount of truth required also requires much intelligence, or much education, and the incompetence sometimes indulged by technocracy has lead me to wonder if our survival as a species, our quality of life, cannot indulge any more incompetence in government by the flexibility of democracy for elected leaders and government employees, when carrying out a process in a non-passionate fashion—indeed, often apathetic—that begins to show less concern for the citizens and more for the leisure and considerations of those participating in government. What type of democracy must govern? If the nation is to be improved, then cannot also democracy be improved, and with sound, fundamental principles that cannot be in error, when we attempt to augment the competence of any democracy?
	I have witnessed institutions, government or otherwise, come to such a low, and apathetic standard, as to adjust processes to such a pointless and apathetic state in a fashion that is meant to coddle the incompetent to a degree that they are not required to maintain any type of standard when they do not need to be correct about something, and to a degree where they do not have to be correct when the situation requires them to be absolutely correct, and such apathy is sometimes found in government, even—it is assumed—in a judge's chamber at times, but we sincerely hope that such does not occur in a jury chamber, if only for lack of familiarity and longevity of routines. If there is something to be said about the 'just-world hypothesis' that has been proven to be wrong, then what might be proven is the concept has often become an infection, if only partial, in the way we reason and think about legislature, understanding, hopefully, that there is a difference between what law is being passed and how the law will actually be wielded, executed, performed, etc. Laws that put in place without exact and limiting sentences and vocabulary are exploited at times to some avail to carry out fraud in a way that was not intended by the law, especially when a police officer refuses to investigate and make an arrest for such fraud being used, and the crimes are only multiplied without justice being executed for the fraud. The police refusing to comply when it comes to offering justice to some people, especially when they have been targeted by fraud by another police officer, or a government employee, is at present not often talked about in our society, but it creates the same problem in society as is considered when one reads about a totally corrupt society, and this is a product of democracy for which it was not intended, but it must be considered when one passes legislature that the legislature will not always be used in the fashion for which it was intended, and there you have a democracy that might be worse than any dictatorship in ancient times because of the veneer of functionality when in fact the system is worse in the way it villainizes people who have been targeted by some type of crime that includes fraud. Stubborn insolence that speaks ignorance is in the mouths of those who are arrogant in a fashion, that they do not consider that this problem effects all of us, not only those groups that an individual might not agree with. So does democracy exist or does in only exist in theory? It seems likely that what is considered is only a theory and what actually is will be something different, and is different now in this present time.
	What line in actually drawn and what barbarity and evil are some not capable of? Excuses do not have to make sense when a person does not perceive the degree of the evil that they do, because they are in fact what they do and something worse. Then it might be considered that we have the sicophant sociopaths who produce strange 'wickedness' or 'evil' that no person could have predicted for its degree of evil, and for that very reason it is wanted by the person who does it, being the person who seeks to defile the holy, or the sacred, with actions that are 'strange wickedness', and this is the presence of a homicidal sicophant who seeks to defile and to destroy what is beautiful. Perhaps it might be right to consider the sheer hate and intense anomocity with which these actions are carried out, that those who do these things are not human, and seek to throw dirt and mud onto something beautiful because they are not. As for psychology, it might be understood that the sub-concious holds much of the truth about people and that for some people what would be in the sub-concious is in the concious and for others what would be concious is in the sub-concious, and then it can also be understood, that which I have proved by understanding to the point of knowledge, is that a person is what they do, what actions they perform, whether verbally, or physically, and if they do not percieve that they are what they do, than they are something worse, or something else, in addition to what they do, and then there is no need for removing the common sense from such a statement, which would indicate hyperbolic discounting, and lend some indication of a sense of offence to such a statement, offering nothing about whether it is true or not, being the reaction of people that seem to hold no weight in such cases to what the truth is about them, for such is multiply determined, and to remove common sense from anything is to make anything dysfunctional, understanding that common sense is the core of psychology and the foundation upon which every item rests, so that the removal of common sense from anything might be viewed as that which becomes anti-social, even if the person is not a sociopath, but a lacking common sense sociopath, which is the next identification I have made, being those who remove common sense from paradigms, concepts, academic fields, and knowledge and understanding, that is might be void of knowledge and understanding, something different from what is mentioned, and ultimately anti-social and foolish to a degree that comprehension is no longer possible and argument is no longer possible.
	The foundation of everything is common sense, and every person has common sense, to the degree that if they do not seem to have common sense, it will be shown in everything they do, that they would be seriously impaired by the absence of common sense in a consistent fashion, so that we do not have speak about the concept of mental illness, when talking about such a person, since mentally ill people are in many different catagories, and what was considered mental illness prior, is not the same as mental illness today, so that there are different catagories of mental illness, and a person cannot use the term 'mental illness' and be expected to have said anything much discernible, or specific enough to apply to any individual, since the amount and variety of mental health disorders is many, and what was considered mental illness during world war II and prior, would not even apply to most people who are deemed to have mental health disorders in this present time, so that even Adolf Hitler, dictator of Germany during world war II, might be considered to have been more liberal and progressive on many topics than some people today, who have transfered concepts and posited them in places they do not belong, refering to crazy people, who would not have been considered crazy by the standard during which the word 'crazy' was used. Certainly many SS soldiers suffered depression, OCD, PTSD, etc. A bi-polar person is not a person with OCD, and a person with depression is not the same as a person who is hallucinating, and none of these different catagories, of which are there are too many to list, describe the differences in mental illness between a person who will commit a crime and a person who is less likely to commit a crime than the average person who has no mental health disorder. The new levels of ignorance being proliferated in The United States of America, and even in Canada, seem to have reached a depth of lacking knowledge that would not have been acceptable, even for Adolf Hitler and the Nazi SS soldiers. If there were ever any negative sentiments towards 'crazy people' those sentiments cannot be applied to people with modern mental illness, and neither can the word crazy be applied to people with mental illnesses, since the concept of a 'crazy person' does not match what the vast majority of people with mental illnesses are. I believe that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi SS would agree with me, although given the truth, I do not believe I require their support on this topic, and I believe that reality should be enough for most people, since ignorance, or a desire to be ignorant, cannot possibly be considered a sane trait by any centuries standard. Since I am not a neo-nazi, or nazi, I do not consult the concepts offered by the genecidal ideas of the early 1900s, which included eugenics, although I am certain that most of the people who believed in eugenics would not believe in it today given the new knowledge we have about genetics and evolution, especially what we know about the effects of inbreeding on the human race.
	What words are dependant on concepts that had an older definition at the time they were used? The failure to invent new words for new things can lead to the transference of old concepts onto totally different concepts. If we are to rely on common sense, we can never stray that far from our human morality, that all people have, understanding that when a person seperates the sheep from the goats, or for a different idea, the good from the evil, it is found that there are more good than evil globally. Therefore let no ideology or belief turn the good against the good. That is not any religion, of course, but a global truth that might be understood, that it is not the majority of the population that often digress into pety wars, where over-reactions and large measures are used for items that are only for the correct time and place, and pety debates, and not even debates that are generally fit for society in its orchastrations of daily life if refused on the bases of wishing for peace on the topic of such matters. Regardless of religion or lack of religion, or what a person's religion might be, there are people who do the right thing and people who do the wrong thing. It is my belief that we do not need another global war, and that we do not need any bloodshed for pety reasons, when such reasons were matters for the correct forum of pety debate, and not for the false-battleground of daily society that is not warned or prepared for any violent conflict, and does not even have the warning to evacuate specific areas for the threat of missle attacks from on far.
	Of course common sense dictates that a terrorist is desperate, has improper weapons at their disposal, is far less powerful by comparison, and thus not in the position to be competent and spare lives, and orchestrating war from a place of weakness, is far more likely to carry out henous actions against the innoccent in a way far less morally acceptable than any military force that has a powerful military, but why they should go below their mental capalities and choose targets that are even more innoccent, when they have the capacity to descern more than they claim, seems to indicate a digression, even, from what their stated cause is, to suggest a person who does not fight in a way that helps themselves or even helps their cause in any way, but is acting like some form of insane animal, that has the capability to use weapons upon random targets, far more like a mass shooter who only spares a small portion of targets, than like any type of freedom fighter in the imaginations of fictionalized history, history, and even fiction. The forces that produce terrorism are claimed to be the same forces that promote racist violence, violent rebellions, ideological violence, and even promote products for purchase, the same forces that are core freedoms required by the inflexible, finite human, who cannot go beyond human capacity, the forces that are embodied in free speech when it comes to those areas that are deemed to be private, such as non-government places, dwellings, art, science, ect. The statement can be offered based in the principles of sheer humanity, that if the world could be better by curtailing free speech or any basic right, than the world cannot be made better by that means, since to remove basic human freedoms would only lead to a less desirable circumstance, which has been proven countless times in history, so that given the knowledge and technology we now have access to, there can be no excuse for the repitition of some mistakes, which are forever abolished, in keeping with common sense with concerns to harassments, so that the re-emergence of some of histories errors might not be viewed with the same magnititude with which they originally occurred, but perhaps the magnitude of such mistakes might be considered to be exponential to what was the case at an earlier time in history.
	The ability to feign inculpability due to ignorance or lack of intelligence by many who have carried out haneous actions against themselves or others based on verbal arguments has indeed decieved some of the more gullible nature, perhaps, into a belief in a false-premise that people above a specific age, perhaps 7 or 8 can actually be fooled into committing crimes or self-harm based on verbal arguments. A developmental psychologist might be able to lend some estimate upon the age at which a child will not touch an electric fence, able to read the words 'ELECTRIC FENCE' and the odds of finding a person over the age of 18 who has such a specific and rare developmental problem that they are unable to comprehend that they should not commit a crime, especially if that crime is an act of extreme violence and a terrorist action. What seems far less rare are individuals who require a sense of intellectual superiority by convincing themselves, and verbally confirming, that others are so much more guilable than them that they do not know how wrong their actions might be against themselves or others, and also less rare is a person who feigns lack of intelligence after they have committed a crime. Common sense is, of course, apparent, and will save humanity from many disasters. Of course we do not believe that any serious criminal is lacking the intelligence to a degree that they do not know what the law is, much in the way we would not, for example, believe that a pedophile lacks the intelligence to not understand that children are not able, yet, to consider the future with concerns to consent, which of course, given common sense, is not necessary to state. The arguments made for terrorism seem to focus less upon the actions of killing civilians, including children, and more upon the vicerol need for retaliation for injustices that have occurred in the world, and of course injustices do occur, and there are plenty, but where such arguments become propaganda is in their failure to explain that those who would be targeted by terrorism are mostly people who would fight against such injustices, and if not, there is The United Nations to monitor the planet, the press, which requires free speech, and the work of activists to expose the atrocities that happen on this planet, and the other acceptable conduits used to combat injustice that do not involve terrorism. Free speech is required to combat injustice, and the oppression of free speech will undoubtably move more conversations to 'The Dark Web' which is accessible with the TOR browser and add to any propaganda a larger sense of veracity and debate power due to the contents elevated status as being 'persecuted' by government powers, that will also, then be persecuting the people merely by removing an essential freedom for humanity. How ridiculous, incompetent, foolish politicians are driving our planet towards a state of anarchy, and the abyss, is again due only to an abandonment of common sense, and a situation in which the population who possesses common sense is repeatedly being pressured with opportunistic guilt and false-choices, again, often based on guilt, to permit our governments to curtail basic freedoms in contradiction to common sense. Even lack of knowledge is being exploited in the new wave, more insidious than ever, to remove free speech from places like the internet, which has never been controlled by the government and is not beholden to any corporation. Add to the debate many who are paranoid of not conforming to what they have been told by a seemingly credible source (often enlightened people given their attitude) or people who do not feel they have enough in-depth knowledge on the subject to dissent from what is not-actually the established view, but seems so if televised, and we have a situation in which a small group of wrong individuals can slip evil past the masses, without their honest support, but by psychologically strong-arming them to come along, with various techniques, and the need for education into psychological techniques with regards to governing becomes more apparent if we are to truly have a democracy that maintains basic freedoms. Of course irrelevant arguments are often returned which seem to suggest that the person did not understand the original case being made, or that the person debating is not able to produce an argument against something, even if others can, and such has become expected in democracy, at a time when bullying and strong-arming is used against the majority of citizens, which does not imply ethnicity or religion, where governments are seemingly more often ignoring the will of the people, and their common sense, and offering only arguments that are long, misleading, and ultimately irrelevant, before moving legislature through that is not democratic and is not passed with the actual support of the people.
	The foolish, and originally obnoxious saying Yes, but have you seen the masses? Seems to be at the core of many political decisions at a time when politicians are seemingly adopting the attitude, contrary to the citizen's view, that the citizens do not know better, and they—with their degrees in political science and social science—know more about terrorism, the internet, gun control, war, science, medical science, physics, computers, history, linguistics, religion, the police, the military, geography, geology, etc., than we know as a people, and the belief seems to be that our common sense about them, even, is not to be trusted or credible anymore, if they are to move the planet in what-direction, we do not know anymore. Given the other type of paranoia that fears not conforming, being the actually paranoid type, at times it is presented to be more aggressive, even offensive to those who do not share such paranoia, and if such paranoia has been created by our politicians, some of us might sincerely hope they burn in hell, the worse one, reserved for liberals, of course, since it is understandable that temporary mental health problems, and anti-social effects have been created by increasingly inconsiderate governments who seem to, if I might offer a metephore, forget the patient's physical capacity while attempting to treat a case of chicken pox, and such is considered to be incompetence, if you are to understand a novella like Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, where incompetence in leadership and otherwise takes place in the jungle to produce catastrophic consequences, something a ship's captain and sailor would understand well, and no doubt would every military soldier, although when our leaders begin to resent their people, they are not really leaders anymore, at least not in the greater truth sense for which we turn to religious texts, and if such is the case in many countries at the time at which I am writing this, it would seem that there is a present rise in resentment on behalf of many of our leaders towards their own people, given their lack of consideration and their refusal to follow the paths of democracy in an honest fashion. A person might imagine leaders who create situations through extraordinairy measures and then when such problems emerge, even in the form of protests, they label their own people terrorists, as much as they can, and then blindly take orders from the ambassadors of selfish groups, governing in such a fashion as to show no concern for their citizens, no amount of real leadership, and such can be witnessed far more often at this present time, when the people are pressed further towards the tipping point and politicians talk over them and change the topic. Yes, some have seen the masses, and in reality, and contrary to what might be considered, their voices can bring the country towards moral common sense when a leader chooses their own people as their councillors and ambassadors in addition to their councillors, rather than being a puppet for selfish groups that are not expected to be unselfish, to the degree that they themselves are not arguing as if they will be taken so seriously that they themselves must be the leader.
	A leader's role is to understand scarcity, whether economic or otherwise, and give the correct portions to the nation so that the whole of the country does not fail while, if I might use another metephore, a surgery, or operation, is taking place. Much like a surgeon cannot allow the whole body to fail from blood loss, a politician, or leader, is expected to give attention to the whole nation which must continue to function, less there come about a situation where there is an even worse problem than the one being addressed.
	Much about humanity is nature rather than nurture, and the nurture that is a result of nature, so that we can begin to identify the core items of knowledge that are part of nature, for humans, that require little, if no education—no nurture to understand—so that we can list such items such a supremacy, in the objective sense, and the core truths of human knowledge that require no education, being that a person with more understanding is superior to the person with much less, that a person with greater intelligence is superior to the person with much less, that wisdom is innocent of evil and does not call for war upon the person who is wise, that person with a misconception that is not acceptable to reality is considered to be 'wicked' in a sense, ect. Such is the knowledge that is included with sentience, so that we talk about extreme and unnatural conditioning when we encounter that which does not seem to perceive, or rather aknowledge, the 'obvious' truths about people, or psychological retardation, known as psychopathy or sociopathy, rather than a mental health disorder like the offensive name 'anti-social personality disorder' a more recent discovery that still has yet to differentiate from the effects of abuse, trauma, and general PTSD, or having emerged from hostile environments, if I might digress into a mental health disorder I am suspicious of or am suspicious of, given the alternatives of the diagnosis, how easily a person might be misdiagnosed with such a disorder when the situation requires absolute infallibility to protect a possible victim who is suffering trauma, meaning the risks do not outweigh the benifits, and here, too, is another item of knowledge that all people have, being the ability to understand basic needs in terms of morality and what is not fitting, seemly, and just, for a person who has been abused in some fashion, by which we are even to some degree able to judge and decern possible guilt of others based on the way they react to victims of abuse. Understanding the digression from just-world function in reality a person can only imagine the horror of an evil person who is dealing with their personal problems and is unable to do the right thing when it comes to a victim, due to their guilt, and unable to relent from further abusing a victim due to their guilt, or unable to have any compassion for a victim, an inhereted problem from the guilt of what they have done, or an inferiority that is not accepted by a person who then seeks to denigrate others in a way that could almost be fatal, especially if such attempts should become violent.
	Of course, there is the understanding of the existence of those who seem to suffer a paranoia, or a slight involuntary phobia, towards the idea that injustice and evil can occur, and thus cling to the just-world hypothesis in their thinking to an over-compensating degree, but then there are also those who have the scientifically wrong concept (the just-world hypothesis) conditioned, it would seem, into their psychies, in a fashion in which it become part of their processing of reality, to a slight impairment, and part of the process of their external efforts, without the awareness, it would seem, that others are offended by the false-premise of all their speech, which is of course perceived as being based on a false-premise. When a person perceives a false-premise in the thinking of others, whether all their speech is perceived to be based on a false-premise, or only some, I call this the perception of ignorance-insolence since it is often seeming to be unmanagable in its ignorance and insolence at the same time, so that many find it difficult to even argue with such a person until the unstated false-premise has been addressed and remedied, or confronted seperately. Humans understand groups and seperations without nurture, the concept being perceptible as it is able to be calculated by the human psychie, and as such anything that is capable of being calculated by the human psychie without any time given to the concept might be considered to be a core truth of humanity that is inherited knowledge by nature. We understand pain and pleasure, hot and cold, what is our own fault and usually what is the fault of others, although the bias seems to be for a misconception in the former for most people, so that when such become inverted, so that the misconceptions for an individual are most often for the later, we consider that person to be anti-social and likely mentally ill or psychologically retarded and impaired. We also perceive that most core truths are never replaced by posited items invented by our society for the purpose of some function, and that core truths are part of common sense, the lacking of which impairs a person in all things that they would attempt to do. Of course removing common sense from religion is not the common fashion in which most people approach religion, whereas over-extensions of concepts, or commandments in a religion, where the commandments do not apply, are seen to be disrespectful to the religion and, or deity, and a type of blasphemy for most religions. Also, when a person considers the way Christians in North America do not follow all of Christianity, we can also consider the way most Muslims do not 'kill the polytheist' as their religious text would command them to do. The use of hyperbolic discounting when talking about the future seems to offer hints about missing the greater concept and truth on a matter, just as most people are good regardless of their religion or lack of religion, it is my belief that it is time to stop fighting needless wars that tear each other's group down, and remember that concept of priorities and the need to build each other up. Society is replete with problems, but then, of course, the ground is cursed for your sake, just as society is cursed for your sake. Why then does any person ask for that which is not good, which is beyond the limit? Quests for Utopia that do not consider the practical limitations of humanity can only bring about a worse situation, and such has been seen before in history.
	Of course the benifits of socialism when it comes to paying for education can be fundemental in ensuring that the better candidates usually get the job, a situation we do not have in North America, where school expenses are impermissably high for most people when adding rent, food, and book costs, to the slightly subsidized student loans. As such we have geniusses who cannot afford to go to school, even a rarer thing, geniusses who get good grades and study, and other people with high marks who have no real path to attaining the education they should have, being the best and brightest, or those who would excel the most if they were given the education. If we are to be a modern society that has advanced beyond the sheer struggle for survival, which in reality we are not, than we can consider some of the options of European countries that make it possible for their students to attend college or University, also giving them places to live while they study. Currently in Canada, our government has done a rare good thing and offered a 28 thousand dollar tuition payment, provided that the college course is short, since the money cannot be used for a longer degree program, a small step in the right direction, when much more is needed for our country where we possess Universal health care, but do not rank high in quality health care compared to many other industrialized nations. Add to the education cost, the shift towards service industry jobs with the removal of many jobs to places where the labour is less expensive and the general outsourcing of many service industry jobs and the removal of service industry jobs by means of great automation, and we are being told we are to be service industry people in the future, and yet we see the amount of jobs being stripped away towards a time when we will encounter a need for a new system for humanity, understanding the planned eventuality of a type of socialism that will be required at that time, but likely not without great unrest. If the COVID crises created economic problems that were worse than COVID, where people did not take two weeks off work, but instead took two years off and lost their houses, moved their children to grandparents homes or foster homes in some cases, became homeless and lived in shelters or died from over-exposure to the elements, our citizens, people who worked hard and had lives before the political decision that brought them to ruin, than a person might be able to imagine the unrest that could occur when most of the jobs disappear to automation and outsourcing and the resrictions that might be placed on the over-use of automation, or abundant outsourcing even if we were to turn to a more socialist environment, or more regulated capitalism, with regulations focusing mostly on keeping jobs for a country. The emergence of inter-dependant economies, and globalization has removed the flexibility of iscolationism that might have been enjoyed at an earlier time, so that nations are inflexible by comparison, beholden to others, and to competition, and unable to always focus primarily on their own people, whether immigrants or not, due to the need to remain competitive and to meet the demands of trade agreements. Another alarmist theory concerns the petro dollar system and the prediction of United States currency flowing back into the economy once oil is traded more often in the Euro than in the US greenback, the theory stating that mass inflation will take place that could severely cripple the United States economy, when in reality the slow easing away of excess dollars, even purposefully wasteful spending into military equipment to ease inflation (which already occurs) makes it unlikely that any disaster would occur, with the addition of Chinese holdings and the possible alliances of dependant countries avoiding economic problems making the alarmist threat of such a disaster more of a hoax than an actual fear. But if survival of the fittest has taught us anything, it is that evolution can indulge chaos, the likes of which might seem impersonal on a cosmic scale, but intolerable for a free-thinking species that is able to plan ahead, and take control of our future, even aid our own species to avert catastrophy. In the case of climate change, we can ascertain that the climate has been much hotter and much colder in the past, even in ancient times, although the ecosystem was strong then, due to less deforestation, and the natural environment would have been more capable of adapting to major climate shifts and new steady states in temperature, especially given the non-endangered status of many species that are on the brink of extinction today, and might not be able to survive the hazards of a climate shift, especially if the polar ice-caps should melt and begin an exponential effect that causes what is called a run-away climate shift, which could result in a new steady state that is considerably warmer than what it is today. Even if we presently have a surplus of polar bears, or any other species, or even if we can attest to the growing population of a previously endangered species, or if we experience a general trend towards cooling, the problem remains that the ecosystem cannot handle a sudden climate shift anymore, and the attempts to minimilize human effects by reducing anthropogenic carbon emmissions is only part of the solution that must also involve protecting ecosystems, whether with capatilism, or government commitments, if we are truly to be a people, whether conservative or liberal, who value the planet we live on and the wild-life and nature that are part of our human experience in the Universe. Whether a nature loving, responsible hunter, who must hunt to save the ecosystem due to the absence of natural predators when the ecosystem would otherwise collapse, entire, without hunting, or an environmentalist who donates funding to the purchase of land for the preservation of species, we all share this planet, whether embroiled in political wars or not, and we are all highly capable of putting pety bickering aside to support that which we, the citizens care about, being the protection of this planet, which is part of our existence, what we are, and reminding us who we are in a vast Universe that is mysterious to all.
	Of course buying a rocket launcher and machine gun is not the same as using that money to purchase land to be protected for wild-life and there is a difference between a radical environmentalist and an environmentalist, just in the same way we understand the concept of valuing human life and in addition valueing animal life, and that a person who does not value human life is not suddenly acceptable, morally, because they have an excessively high opinion of animal life, that does not need to be proven in a fashion that seems like an over-compensation for an actual lack of care for something, or a quest to prove a religious zeal when a person has attempted to show themselves religious in some fashion, the juivanille aspect of both being readily and easily understood, and yet we still continue to find the older, antiquated aspects of many items in our society, things that were the quarrels of past generations, but not of my generation, generation Y, which keeps enduring the attempts of older generations to indoctrinate us into their nonsense, the querrals of seemingly older siblings and their girlfriends and boyfriends, when our generation merely wishes to break off and do our own thing, pursue our own dreams. How many of those people exist seems to indicate a pandemic of people who are old and jelous and keep trying to bring us into their trade, into their problems, which we are not all compatible with, not wishing to do what they did, and not being represented on television in our actual forms and reality, but by what an older generation is intentionally portraying us as, in keeping with them, and more like they are, and not showing what we really are. Sibling jelousy has been directed towards us since we have begun to become of interest to the older generations, being plucked from the metephorical craddle and already being indocrinated into concepts that do not apply to us but are incompatible with our purpose and destiny, which is different than that of our older siblings. Inappropriate attempts to use concepts meant for people who are older than them or of the same age, and demanding more respect than any older generation or person is entitled to in functioning society, and we can only hope to slip away, undetected, and start our own society with our own hopes and dreams, abandoning our jelous older siblings to their own mayhem and strife with which they grappled with each other during their time, and are now attempting to use on us in a way that does not apply to us and what we are. Let their crimes and wrongs be their own, and as they have made the mess and wish to bring us into it, let them grow old and die with their own mess that we do not understand or know how to deal with for its chaos and inability to function. Their wars do not have to live on in us, for we are our own people, individuals, and not merely here for them, as the younger generation. The happenstantial segregation is already there, for by chance, it is a great divide, perhaps uncommonly large for what is viewed in history, and yet the divide is there, and the older generation built up too much, challenged too much, randomly invented too much, by chance and chaos, and they have filled the bucket full, and there is no more room for us, and so the divide is large and cannot be altered. Some of my generation has ended up on the street because of them, victims of crimes and their jelousy, and homeless for a time in the city where I presently reside, people my own age who pan handle and attempt to make their way back into society, and this is almost the norm in the city I am in. The older generation are the people who choose how to portray us on television, and what is shown is not us, and the values that must go beyond the limit of the limit, are not our values, for they have nowhere left to go with the narrative, and our own representation is and can only be what we truly are, and what we are is being swept away and cohersed and partially controlled by the older generation and their strong-arming techniques. We are incompatible with their doctrines, and have yet to have the same problems as them, but we have witnessed their pety querrals as we grew up, and are now only wondering, or perhaps some of us, if we really need to do things the same way they did, or if we can have our own, gentler, better, society, that does not have to fight wars over pety matters, and inheret all the goals of the older generations, who have planned their empires long into the future, hundreds of years after they will have been gone, and we have yet to know what we want, and if any of this is good or not. To use a metephore that should not be over-extended, Benjamin did not want to stay in Egypt and did not want to come on the trip, but wanted to go out on his own. The different planet that our generation might form does not have to include those concepts that we are not compatible with, and those of us who have been swept up in their doctrines, do not need to fight their wars any more when we do not have the same problems. So much of what occurred, happened because of their problems, and so many of us who are alienated from our generation become easy prey to the pedophile-like recruiters who would indoctrinate us into their problems, that are not ours. We might be the generation that can understand better, based on psychology and not those politics that go against science and push science away, where the foundations of truth that society is based upon, gets cast away by the the base and ignorant who cast away the foundation of truth and apply wrong, with over-extensions of concepts, and misinterpretations, that which was being applied for good, using concepts that are contained in context, and waging war in ways in which those concepts were never found and meant to be applied, and taking for literal the exagerations of others, when venting, like the citizen soldier who carries out a war crime that no soldier would ever commit, for its cruelty and barbarity, and these are only some of the reckless war-habits of an older generation that periodically goes to war with each other, seeming to hate each other, and stoop to far lows in their contentions, and what is there left, but psychology, real science, to offer the actual truths when so much of societal facts, that are not always true, sometimes attempt to push science away, offended by what cannot be said, but in fact, it can, because science is not society, and the societal facts have become too numerous, and have filled up everything to the extinction of conversation so that we have found a new planet, and that planet is the Earth of tomorrow.
	Religion is part of humanity, or can be, and atheism is part of humanity, or can be, and the freedom to choose is a basic freedom of humanity, any society not allowing such, as well as freedom of speech, not erradicating a problem, but becoming the problem that is to be avoided. It is possible to talk about socialism, capatilism, adjusting, and fixing, without erring into extremes that are often unintelligent ways of looking at the larger system in place, killing the host to remove a parasite. Those paranoid of not conforming, or those who must display loyalty, do not need to be included in the discussion due to their inability to speak freely, and those shunning truth with bullying do not have to be taken seriously when they will not be reasonable and argue in a way that seeks knowledge and understanding. We know by common sense that terrorism is not the military fighting a military and that it is an extreme evil that is never an option, whether powerless and desperate or not, just as we can understand that criminals are not to be defended more by the government than the law-abiding citizen who commited no crime, and that acts of justice are not to be labelled terrorism, and neither are acts of self-defence, when it is truly self-defence, which only erradicates the boundaries and pushes a nation towards further extremes, the adherence to justice and the integrity of it, keeping the system together during tumulteous periods. We can use the voice of reason and the obvious to understand a concept like a person pushed by a group of bullies to some extreme action, who will not likely tell the truth about what was occurring and for how long before the extreme action took place, or how many of them there had been, and what number of numerous pety crimes they might have committed against the person, pushing them beyond the human limit to an understandable conclusion given what was occurring, and of course this is not for some to say, but it is for the judge, and it is for the citizen who wishes to judge such matters from an arm-chair, understanding the lies that are told, and the evil that a group of bullies can carry out, even as adults, and of course we know that a homicide in self-defence, is not the same as a murder, that a theft in a crises situation, is not the same as a theft for financial gain, that throwing a punch in self-defence is not the same as assault, that taking a car that is not yours, when there is a crises situation that involves weapons, is not the same as stealing a vehicle. Honesty can be hard to come by when the person who has not committed the extreme action is guilty of much that might have lead to the action. Of course the small crimes must be enforced, when such becomes an intolerable hazard, so that the greater crimes will not occur, and to fail to take action is a crime for a person when they have taken an oath by law to serve and protect. If the police are picking and choosing which crimes to investigate and charge than we have a system in which the police have gone rogue from the government and are not only choosing not to answer to any higher power, but are placing themselves, unlawfully, as the only governing power in our society, since law enforcement is the core, the Rome that all roads lead to, the great conduit through which everything else must pass of great consequence, and he who controls the police force controls the country, so that if the police force is ever rogue, they are the main government of the country. The situation becomes worse when we incur temporary periods of tribal anarchy in society, where different government groups will not comply with each other, and only protect their own tribe, working on a retaliation system, like with desert tribes, and refusing to be honest with the police or other agencies, protecting their own people no matter what they might have committed, and having no regard for anyone who is not in their tribe, being tribal anarchy, which is common at times, and disappears at others, within a democracy, so that we go through periods of anarchy that are not reported by the newspapers. The type of information that cannot be in the newspaper often pertains to what cannot be investigated by a journalist, and in situations of tribal anarchy there is defence for the average citizen so long as there is no conflict with any of the tribes, since the average citizen does not have a tribe, unless of course they are a member of a criminal gang, and it seems unlikely, given the temporary nature of such states of anarchy that citizens would have to resort to joining gangs, or organizations for protection and for the insurance of justice when dealing with the variable tribes. Government agencies and groups can break off from one another, as can different police forces, and if the federal government is then on its own, we are sometimes, unknowingly in a situation where many citizens have far less than the adequate level of support and defence and must often wait for the invisible tumult to subside, and such will never likely be reported by a newspaper, even if this non-fiction piece should be well read, since the system must continue to function and re-establish itself, the seemingly progressing system seeming to find back-ups, and hopefully righting most wrongs later, but likely not all, for there are still cases unresolved, complaints dismissed, crimes un-investigated, and such compromises do not need to be considered necessary when proper oversight is keeping the various agencies doing their job, despite disputes. Bribes, corruption in its various forms, and cities that operate more by crime than by justice, and a person can likely be assured that there is more corruption to be found than is visible, and that a surgery is required, and a trickle down of cleansing from injustice, rather than a sludge hammer to cure the city, that would swallow up the good and bad, alike, as is the ancient concept.
	A person might look at the problems created by terrorist organizations to destabilize countries and consider the equivelliences found in tribal anarchy and various government groups that become rogue and seek to dismantle a country or region for periods of time, the rich being targeted by such corruptions of government as well as the poor, and business being hindered due to what can be painted with a general term as 'instability' in a region where it becomes almost impossible to do business and profit an area. Add to that instability, the problem of entitled and corrupt government people, hindering business in the demand for a bribe and the region becomes unprofitable in reality even if in theory it seems like a good place to do business, and of course the police could bring about stability to a region that has much instability, although it seems to almost be taken for granted that in an unstable region, the police, too, are not doing their jobs. Worse than an insurgency of terrorists in a region, and perhaps almost as catastrophic at times as a foreign invader is when a region become so corrupt and unprofitable that people must flee, while more problems flow in to the area, which if left to spread, can cripple an entire nation.
	When terrorists work under-cover to destabilize a region, or country, the effects can be catastrophic if a country does not diligently respond to the problem, and in the case of a foreign nation exhibiting the same behaviour with under-cover operatives, the government must have the budget and resources to locate the problems and deal with them in a safe and surgical fashion that does not harm its own citizens. In a situation of temporary tribal anarchy the situation could only be made worse by under-cover operatives, who do not just operate overseas in such a manner, attempting to further destabilize a region by exploiting the tribal anarchy to plant evidence, commit fraud, and essentially eliminate some of the best citizens a country has, as well as some of its businesses in efforts to throw people in prison during the period of tribal anarchy, collect intelligence, and even steal engineering ideas that have not been patented, causing a major harmful incursion to another country while the public generally goes unaware than anything of the type ever took place, and the same can be said for some of those in government who did not receive intelligence that such a situation occurred.
	For some these periods can be treated like times, not just of tribal anarchy, but of total, chaotic anarchy, as opportunities to carry out acts against people for grievances that can be personal, ideological, political, religious, etc. The exploitation of the instability to settle grievances and attack people that a person or group does not appreciate, can only further add to the chaos and instability of a region, and given that the police in such situations are considered to be overburdened, or compromised, some citizens can find themselves in difficult situations with no help to gain at the time, waiting for justice that might be delivered for them at a later time, without their knowing what is occurring, and the severity of the situation in the midst of the invisible, barely detectable mayhem, when the situation is invisible, and possibly waiting in a similiar fashion when the situation is visible to the public, which is what is sometimes witnessed on news shows that are televised in North America and globally. It can be possible for refugees to flee a country when the situation has not yet become visible to the public, although we often talk about incoming refugees after the situation has become visible to the world. The times of crises can be varied, and the times of tribal anarchy can be periodic when it happens, and yet still we have the various words of politicians during a crises situation who mention the concept of not putting more pressure on the public during a crises situation, essentially indicating incompetence by a leader who is tightening their grip when they should loosen it, or not using a precise enough scalpel for the situation, where accuracy is required so as not to make the situation worse. Anti-social personalities carrying out hostile actions during a crises is something that might be explained by a psychologist or sociologist, although what is certain is that desperate people who have committed wrong sometimes wish to exploit chaos, and the amount of crimes can rise during a crises, produced by some who might not normally commit such types of crimes. Fighting fire with peace often causing the fire to sputter out and disperse, whereas firing upon protestors, or generally fighting fire with fire, only increases the likelyhood of greater escalation. Consider a Scotland pushed to rebellion daily by a foolish and overbearing king, probably a homicidal sicophant when considering his strange wickedness and desire to desecrate in ways increasingly strange and aggressive, although he was stategic in terms of military, and you might imagine the lack of governing wisdom that many have shown in history, still failing to understand the fundemental concepts of governing so that obvious foolishness has been committed that would only incite a rebellion, and then consider the incompetence of some leaders in modern times, some of them who resent their own people, when their people are those who support them, and are their kingdom itself that they would glorify and promote, and it becomes neccessary at some time that education for governing might be granted in which the basic concepts might be taught in order to advert catastrophie. A leader respects their people, promotes their people, defends their people, respects the freedoms of their people, makes careful choices concerning their people, etc. The idea that any person can be a politician seems to be a misconception that has no origin but is rooted in the callow, spectacular imaginings of people who would require others to educate them constantly while governing and lack the essential items of understanding in terms of governing and the knowledge necessary to lead a people, a position that requires an exceptional individual who is beyond the average for the task. Competence is not performing at the lowest level, but understanding sufficiently, almost totally, with a mastery of the task at hand, and it is of course not make-believe, or dress-up, but requires excellence in a field. The concepts of wisdom that are to be understood cannot readily be found in some of the more popular sources of society, and seem to be absent from any education within the realm of technocracy, depending on the course, only it is the role of the artist, essayist, author, to often confirm that which does not require stating, understanding the realm and level of sentience, and that the digression from the level of sentience indicates mental illness, whether an unnecessary digression in speech that is not required or in both speech and thought, the practise of such being mental illness. Of course there is also the person who cannot reason at an average level and so brings down everything in discussion or debate to their level consistently throughout the conversation, and here we find an incompatibility to debate due to a lower level of reasoning not capable of communicating and comprehending at the same level, at which point the debate becomes futile, even inconsistent in terms of concepts, and such can occur in politics at time, although it is understood that it is still the role of a leader, if they understand more, to attempt to be patient, especially for a nation's natural reactions to what is occurring, understanding that a leader who resents his own people cannot be said to truly understand his role as leader, even if he does understand more.
	It can be understood, also, that logical consistency, or merely consistency in truth, is wisdom, the idea being possibly discovered by Mesopotamians approximately 2000 years ago, in the awkward mention of wisdom not being a hypocrite, consistent with the awkward and often vague way of stating such things that is perhaps more consistent with spiritual language that is unnecessarily difficult to understand. Of course inconsistency of logic is mental illness, or a person might only say, inconsistency, whereas we often find that to remain in debate without hypocracy ultimately has the better result in matters where such debate is manifest in real scenarios, much in the way a nation that remains consistent, and a leader who keeps a nation consistent is more likely to bring a country to a much better outcome in the world. My disapproval of agencies like The United States Central Intelligence Agency, or other agencies that do the wrong thing in the name of prudence and wisdom, comes from my belief that such actions and even principles for strategy are an abomination, believing that it is the nation's role to first and foremost do the right thing, regardless of some corrupt proverb or principle that would involve committing injustice that a better state might come of, as if anything better could come from committing injustice. We do not support terrorists to bring about peace, and we do not support injustice based on some concept of corrupt wisdom, which I do not believe to be wisdom, but something that might seem correct, but is actually foolish. This is my own view of governing, the concept of wisdom remaining with morality, which I too, like others, believe is the truth. If a person should die, then they die, and we do not negotiate with them in disrespect towards the victims, and if a person does not deserve to die, we do not kill them out of respect for our own lives. If one of ours endangers us by committing crime against our neighbour, we do not defend them in support of their actions against our neighbour, and if one of us says that they did not know, we do not spare them out of respect for our own lives. Universal truths do not have to be mixed with other concepts for us to understand them, just as we do not have to follow the interpretations that are beyond what is our burden and accept guilt for such things. Sanity is a given, the standard of which is understood, and beyond the thresh-hold people are pretending to be more insane than they are, the levels of emotional lack of restraint perhaps requiring no reason anymore and possibly being the apothesis of what we consider to be insanity, whereas all other types, when coupled with self-control, we consider to still be more sane. Religious zeolots often abandon reason, and abandon religion, for some over-compensating emotional response that has more to do with their own pride than with the defence of any religion that might not actually require any retaliation, since ideas, truths, do not require any acts of people to remain, since the eradication of all copies is never likely. First and foremost comes that which is atheistic entirely, being our basic rights and freedoms that require no religion, and exist without a diety and serve as the foundation that must always remain. In practise the provisions by which freedoms are removed is not adhered to and fraud is often committed as well as evidence-planting, so that the legal system must be altered and all loop-holes closed for criminals who wish to remove freedoms from law-abiding citizens, from criminal cases, to concepts like financial competence, where the laws must be better written to ensure the safety of citizens from criminal activity, and the police must be willing to investigate where crimes are occurring, in the process, that would remove freedoms from citizens, otherwise practises that might be argued for, in theory, cannot continue to exist in practise in our democracy. The just-world hypothesis cannot be used in debates and arguements that would promote the use of exceptional measures when people might be deemed incompetent in some fashion, just as the hypothesis cannot be used when argueing for the present criminal court system and police procedure that is used to place people in prison. Morally inferior people, as I have understood to the point of knowledge, proving such by understanding, are incapable of doing the right thing for a person if they have even a pety problem with the person, that could simply be some political prejeduce, bigotry, or jelousy, or some other item, whereas morally better people are capable of doing the right thing for a person even when they have a much larger problem, able to over-come their impulses for the purpose of being fair in a matter, even if there is still a grievance that must be delt with in another fashion, and of course moral inferiority, and being morally better, has nothing to do with ethnicity or gender, but has only to do with the individual. The same is true for the Christian religion, of course, which claims the concept of high and low, superior and inferior, which has nothing to do with ethnicity or religion, but has only to do with an individual, regardless of their ethnicity or religion, but then I do not expect to change any minds on the topic of Christianity, and can only offer my own understanding. If the letters have been added to in the New Testiment, between the time of the disciples and the present, I would probably understand the religion better, or if the letters, many of them, were never meant to be included, but were only informal correspondence, much like sermons, than I would again understand the religion better, but as such I personally take some of what is found in the New Testiment with a grain of salt and other items I dismiss, as not being correct in some fashion, although I still respect every religion. As Emporer Nepoloan tells us that there is no military strategy theory, only what will work in practise, so we must, as a human species, realize that there is what we have in theory, will have in theory, and what the reality will be once something is put into practise, and we must calculate for criminals, morally inferior people, mistakes, lack of funding, and lack of resources to deal with such problems, and then decide whether we can sufficiently and safely do something, subject to further investigation and ongoing investigation for the safety of the citizens who reside in a democracy. If a risk assessment will ensure us that problems will arise, it is likely that the risk assessment is far too bias, and inadequate, on behalf of the just-world hypothesis, and that the risk-assessment itself, if used, is a sign that there are already problems, due to an inadequate response to the situation at hand, being a meagre risk-assessment. Dismissive measures are what they are called, and seek to offer a veneer of handling a problem, when their only purpose is to offer a false effort to investigate so that something might proceed, or proceed as usual. Such dismissive tactics are used often where lack of resources do not allow for the proper investigation of safety of citizens, something that must be stated honestly to the public and those who make inquiries, but often is not, whereas actual dismissive measures are cited, and claimed to be legitimate, which is also something that has come to be expected too often in the world.
	It might not take much time to arrive at a better court system, such as when the procedure is made more logical and scientific, not allowing attempts for a runaway jury, where evidence is submitted in a clear and logical fashion, and then cross-examined by experts such as scientists and medical experts in written fashion, at which time, if the evidence does not hold up by a scientific standard, it is considered dismissed, and then if not enough evidence is able to pass through the written cross-examination procedures, the jury or judge is not capable of offering a guilty verdict and the procedure which would take place in which the more subjective opinions of a judge or jury might require education into the case by the lawyer beyond auditing the written cross-examination procedures, would not take place, as the case would be dismissed early by the more objective written cross-examination phase of the proceedings. How evidence would be dismissed in this initial phase, just beyond discovery, would have to rely on science, and sound scientific criteria that is inflexible, so that if the police were not capable of producing a case, the case will have to be dismissed.
	The possibilities for other adjustments to be made for the safety of citizens relies on the public first understanding that the system is not corrupt in favour of any ethnicity, and even if more people from a specific ethnicity are targeted by such corruptions, the possibility still exists, just as readily for such corruption to target any group, even what might be perceived as being the majority group, the attempts of cosmic racial war, or societal war of some type, not requiring the use of a corrupt system to fight for a cause, and of course, I do not support that cause, but dealing with such is outside the scope of this book. If some believe they would never be targeted by such corruption, than they are likely naive to what exists in the world, and the enemy which is the enemy of all of us, even our children in some cases, who can sometimes become targeted by fraud and abuse from individuals in a system who have a strong sense of safety and security, given their view as acting in a formal, professional role of some type. If impoverished mothers must deal with the harassing threats of jealous people taking their children away from them when it is not required than certainly children, women, men, teenagers, the elderly, the disabled, the mentally ill, can all be targeted by individuals who are morally inferior or generally corrupt in some fashion. Human sentience contains the ability to understand many things that are self-contained within humanity, being the science of the perception of reality that we understand others with the use of the brain that processes speech, behaviour, larger actions, ect, and forms a sub-concious and concious understanding of another person that can often manifest itself in actions that eminate from the sub-concious, the idea that substance, true substance, dictates all in a way that cannot yeild, cannot be altered, being the concept of truth and humanity, and thus the idea of the existence of God, a diety, or merely the truth of the Universe as it contains an intelligent, sentient species, known as humanity, who can then only be said to be sentient to a level, as the perception can then be grappled with to some extent that given the amount in the subconcious and the limitations of calculating power, there are greater levels of sentience that could come with more mental ability. Substance is all, the defining and final judge by the truth of the Universe, believed in and known by atheists as truth, to others as the perception of the existence of God, or gods. Perhaps there is no theory, but only evidence by probability statistics to show us the outcome of the substance by the fact that the truth will be shown by the quantity, or number, after that number has exceeded the early phase of non-visibility of substance. How then do we detect a virus in the system that's negative side-effects are not perceived until after a specific and unknown offset has been surpassed? What alterations are made by the mass of subconcious individuals to rebalance in the grande scheme of things that's increments might exist by thousands of years until the rebalancing efforts have even manifest themselves as corrections and effects of the initial attempts to rebalance? There we have the introduction of the just-world hypothesis that is beyond the scope of the hypothesis and beyond the time period for which the hypothesis is false, and so theoretically I have introduced the concept of the theoretical challenge to what was considered to be an obvious fallacy, at least a logical fallacy in terms of debate, whereas outside the limits of such a fallacy we find that common sense is again neccessary, and that hyperbolic discounting does not erase the status of fallacy, and the wrong identification of the fallacy as being something like a scientific forumula, and not a concept that must rely upon common sense leads to the conclusion of the mentally impaired person who does not calculate such instantaneously, but becomes confused by the argument, or their own arguement, and here is something within the realm of one but not the other, where an impaired person cannot be convinced, and if they are truly impaired, and thus stubborn in their lack of understanding, there might be nothing left to do, for the sake of survival, but to physically remove such a person, and yet we have the structure and the boundaries of our systems, where common sense would then lead us to the conclusion that in some situations it is right to take action, but at one time, and in what cases are compromises neccessary, and what will be the result of such actions being taken more often? How then is it possible to know all, and to know the future, not knowing what events will manifest thousands of years from now, and what humanity is moving towards, and what the result of a new concept will be? But we operate within the paradigm that is smaller, and enclosed to us, and yet there are some of us who do not have the full measure of that smaller paradigm within their ability to calculate, and such are sometimes given responsibilities that involve the safety and welfare of others. Often the larger scope is dismissed with a wave of the hand, a refusal to 'waste' time understanding, for the easier simplicity of the smaller system, but the larger system, if it can be had by some, is possible at another level, and then we have a different state of awareness that encompasses more with effort or instantaneously, and thus is the comparison of the impaired person to the average person. If we are to consider a group of jelous men who believe themselves to be victims of injustice due to what is only reality, we need only to quote Darwin, or even the New and Old Testiment, to explain the increased inferiority of being selfish and claiming injustice while challenging the concepts of reality and existence, as if nature has committed some injustice, without the effort to better a situation, or show gratitude for what a person has, but to lash out against that feminism that does not even offend men, to lash out at those who deal with jelousy and unfair bias because of that, to be self-pitying, selfish, blind to the basic concepts of others and what they must deal with, and difficult, at times, to understand, for their ingratitude for what is offered with reality, as if nothing will be enough for these people, at which point the basic portion of sympathy that is offered is not enough, and no sympathy is given to others in a different situation, so that I will only state that such sympathy would not be wanted from me, or somebody like me, and would likely be rejected, unwelcome, and as for the reality that we understand, I imagine that we can only dismiss the creation of fiction for what we understand. Oh, and Fuck You. 
	If we look at a group like involuntary celebate, or INCEL, we find the anti-sentimental group, manifest in mysogeny and hatred of sentimental men, the anti-love, romantic or otherwise, anti-good, anti-Christ group under a different name, and also the anti-all-religion, that does not value anything that is sentimental, like the older brother of Jacob in the Old Testiment, who would sell his blessing for a meal because he considers it to be worthless, the terrorist group that no person could have anticipated, that goes against the Universal atheistic or religious values of humanity, essentially being anti-human in their ideologies, that seem to come from an embittered, loathsome, and self-pitying profile that seems to go beyond the bounds of extremism and what can be considered terrorism, to be portrayed as something spiritual, carrying out spiritual war-fare in society in the role of the anti-Christ, or anti-human, and in no way being atheist, for their anti-human views. A group that seems to be outside the bounds of a terrorist organization and what can be considered terrorism, that embodies the spiritual struggle of anti-human against humanity, being then people who would be considered a danger to others in terms of mental health, who have found each other on the internet and violated the boundaries of the denial they might have given, to be beyond 'wacko' or 'evil' in the fashion in which they have sought to abandon the denial of jelousy and being anti-human in which they openly proclaim their views of being anti-human, not in keeping with a religion, or an ideology that already existed, but attempting to weakly add some sort of ideology to in essence what they are, and their base impulse to attack what they are jelous of. Citing things that were never the case historically, being perhaps all the evil figures of the Old Testiment, and none of the good, being against the basic understanding of humanity, being against the rights and freedoms of women to be what they are, to even exist, and being against the rights and freedoms of being sentimental and good, for men, they are against all humanity, seeming to go beyond and stoop lower than anything we thought possible, for their evil. Are they even terrorists, or have they added terrorism to first being an evil person? They find others like themselves and then seem to add what they can to the idea of commiting violence like a wacko, and then commiting such violence against those they do not even know in an organized fashion. Identifying as being ugly when they are not even ugly, as part of their doctrine of self-pity, that seems to hint at concepts such as sicophantic, and they are possibly sicophants and homicidal, being also homicidal sicophants as well as anti-human. Life is not fair. They do not seem to realize that they are merely ungrateful and unhappy with their portion. Of course life is not fair, and people do not always receive all that they should, but the fashion in which they challenge reality seems to indicate people who cannot be reasoned with, for they understand well what they are, perhaps. A person might consider the sub-concious battles, or adjustments that take place in society, where the sub-concious of people manifests itself in spiritual wars, on the small scale, that are not considered religious wars, and then consider the open spiritual war of what can only be the anti-humanity organization, and a person might come to the proverb sometimes the sky is truly falling, and it is the role of the good to put it back. The world has been pressured in many ways, and can survive, given that the good and right are able to keep real understanding and remember to value that unity that exists when we are all being threatened by the Universal enemy. The ability for governments, then, to call the internet server that hosts websites where evil people are able to meet and organize becomes even more vital for the survival of innoccent lives, that the government be able to hault such website hosting for those who violate the terms of free speech when it comes to organizing people for a terrorist organization, given that some of these people are not likely to organize and carry out organized violence when they are seperate, and would more likely come to the conclusion that they are capable of changing themselves for the better, which is only human, and that they will abandon any plans to commit illegal actions, or be delt with seperately by the police, rather than in an organized fashion after they have committed acts of terrorism.
	As a person who values freedom of speech, and is connected by my youth to the computer hacker culture, I do not take my stance in defence of the internet's freedom and freedom of speech so far as to defend the rights of some people to host or mantain websites that offer a place for terrorists or potential terrorists to organize. Such websites should be in violation of the terms of service for an internet host, but where they are not, I support the government's ability, should they have it, to remove such websites from an internet host and to prohibit an internet host from hosting such content. Of course I do not believe in embittered people misusing such government powers against people for whom it does not apply, who are exercising real freedom of speech, due to their anger towards their government organization's actions against what is not permitted to make some sort of statement, and sow discord between the government and good citizens. But then some things, perhaps, do not have to be stated, only knowledge is sometimes more convenient when identifying the real problems in society. We can understand that there are good people and evil people, regardless of their religion or lack of religion, and this is probably a truth that is part of sentience, and not often used when expressing angst and defending principles of one's own tribe, and of course, then, not always necessary to state, until we have a common enemy, the Universal enemy, which is only common sense. Let no person claim that atheists are INCEL which we know by sentience, by common sense, is not true, and in such desperate situations, where violence is being carried out, we do not need people capatalizing and exploiting with exxagerations to further their own tribe's agenda, when we are dealing with a Universal enemy. Further disarray is never just, and labelling people falsely is of course, only name calling, slanderous, and unjust, and of course why would any person be an INCEL and why would any person consider that any person is such? It is obvious that no person is an INCEL since all people are considered to be in keeping with humanity, all of humanity, unless some extreme is found to be otherwise, human until proven guilty, as it is. INCEL is not a byword, an offensive name, something that should be cheapened for the result of confusion, and to call somebody an INCEL, given how extreme and evil the INCEL group is, might be considered worse than saying that a brown person is ISIL or Al'Queda, given that a terrorist organization that is so violent, is not a joke, and as such, I will offer society something, which is that it is not decent, sentimental, sensitive, to call a person an INCEL, and so the whole of it seems like projection, a contradiction, to call any person something so horrible, since the person who says such is the only person being an INCEL, and an INCEL can be a man or woman, of any ethnicity, and so I am suspicious of anything that would seek to confuse people on this matter, and cheapen the seriousness of the situation with disgusting name calling that references anti-humanity and violence. I do not believe we should allow the existence of INCELs to alter our society for one ideology or the other, whether materialistic, sinful, or the opposite, being the greater amount of reverence and sentimental. But I believe that the existence of INCEL is to be dismissed from societal views, since we have common sense, understand the variation of people, how some are more sentimental than others, and we must only view, in my opinion, the existence of INCEL to be anti-humanity, what is against all, and will not become part of our vocabulary or views of humanity.
	Imagine a system that has different items at different sides of different spectrums, and then imagine something that is foreign to that system and does not belong there at all, and can not, or should not, be adapted and brought into that system, because it is too extreme and alien to that system. Then you will understand what INCEL is, something to not influence the system in any way. If we do not allow even religious terrorism to change our way of life, than we especially would not allow what is anti-human, and foreign to humanity, to influence or alter our way of life. Then you might not look at INCEL as being at the extreme side of any spectrum, but merely, or henously, being completely outside all the spectrums and the system, which is the embodiment of humanity. If a person is not as sentimental as others, they are not operating outside of humanity, just as a person who is more sentimental, like myself, is not operating outside of humanity, and is not considered to be more human because they are more sentimental. When it comes to something truly anti-human, we do not use the concept of humanity with a regard for degrees of humanity, but merely a definition that supplies a label which is assumed until something is found to be outside of that assumed label, for us all. That is not to say that an INCEL themselves is not human, but that they are, by their proclaimations, anti-human, and by their violent actions, which are anti-human, they are acting against the concept of humanity, which is the given for all, human until proven guilty, much like innoccent until proven guilty, but even more a given and taken for granted in the way it is expected. Then you can imagine that INCEL is too extreme for any of us, and completely incompatible and foreign to humanity, even, possibly, to religious terrorists and other terrorists. If they are then too extreme for terrorists, than we can only imagine that the government might require more funding to deal with such a threat to humanity, and that further measures to educate the public might almost be detrimental to society if that education can not be delivered in a way that would not allow embittered people to exploit the knowledge by using it incorrectly in a way that causes confusion and discord on the subject when considering people are angry about the government's efforts and societies stance, essentially being the type of player who lashes out to cause disarray when they are actually upset about the unification against something, being another device in the house of the anti-Christ, if I might use a metephore, that we are capable of understanding, much as we are capable of understanding the harrassment method to attempt to stop people from doing something, being the criminal harrassment method by which a person might bully or harrass a person to do something so that they will be far less likely to do something, much like offensively ordering a person to do something when they are willing to do something, but not willing to comply given the rudeness, or offensive method used to attempt to acheive a goal, something that is understood by almost all terrorists, as the harrassment method that is actually carried out to attempt to stop a person from doing something, and should be common knowledge for the public, and yet it is not. Given that domestic terrorists, possibly even people who visit the correct internet websites, know about such methods, I would suggest that all people in society should understand the anti-social strategies that a military person might be taught about various combat strategies, methods of propoganda, psychological warfare, etc, to keep society safe and able to function with the support of good citizens when identifying such harmful behaviour. So I will here call this the harrassment strategy which wants the opposite, and makes the opposite far more likely, and can even make the goal impossible when the harrassment has become frequent enough and bad enough that the mental health of a person makes complying impossible, which is not mental illness, but merely a part of humanity, and what human beings are incapable of. Such items are understood when a person might study terrorism and combat strategy and the various methods used by domestic terrorists, that I would like to explore further in the scope of this book, when dealing with variable factors that are too much for society to combat unless we digress to the inclusion of combat defence as part of our daily lives, which should not be necessary, but can still be helpful to understand for all. Of course, as I have already written about the strong-arming tactics of various political forces, using guilt pressure in an unfair way for society to achieve a goal, I would also write about the unfairness of using psychological warfare tactics and strategies in society against people who are merely engaged in their daily lives who are not responsible for being vigilante against such strategies and are also not prepared to deal with them, and the abomination of using such war-like strategies on a civilization that is not at war. Left-wing persecution towards people are not being offensive, and might even be liberal, or right-wing persecution that is meant to sow discord and drive people further to the left, or any other un-normal situation that seems to be an exageration of what common sense would expect can be a likely culprit for softer terrorism carried out by angry employees of something, in a way that might seem less severe to the person carrying out such tactics so that they feel they cannot be prosecuted, and sometimes it is in fact difficult to prosecute, especially when some police officers share the same grievances, which being written, is hopefully not the case, as we can all exercise the common sense understanding that we do not solve any grievances by participating in and going along with even soft terrorism, that might be due to some angst on a topic. Those of us who do not believe in segregation should be allowed to exist in peace without any unnecessary hassles from any person, whether a minority or not, who wishes to exagerate or portray something that is not true in an attempt to drive people towards a sense that segregation is right, whether the ideological, or the ideological who are merely jelous and driving people away, those of us from generation Y do in fact have the right to live in peace if we do not desire segregation, and are capable of deciding for ourselves who we want to be around and who we want as a romantic partner, the later of which, is of course, no one else's business, and it is a dessecration and abomination to attempt to seperate people who are romantically involved, which could not be the will of any moral diety. It is my belief that the police are better than we imagine, but given their role, they are not your friend who is there to spend time with you and have fun, and this, too, might be considered common sense. Also it is difficult to question the police and any bias they might have when the greater problems might exist, such as crimes being committed, at which point it becomes difficult to seperate valid critisism of the police, or a specific unit, and that which does not grasp the greater concept from people, themselves, who might be more bias, so that the idea of addressing any matter with the police is often shunned by the police, who have delt with too much bias from outside the police force to readily trust people who might critisize them. It is my belief that when we respect the police, we are more likely to gain trust on a topic that needs to be addressed, but of course there are many problems that must be addressed by someone, and without wishing to sow discord between the police and the public, or the public and the police, I would offer the concept of assuming that the police want what is good, in general, or the majority do, and that to approach any problem with such an attitude is more likely the attitude that can lead to real progress on a topic. As for the tactics used like pushing liberals right, with left-wing, false-persecution, driving liberals away because of a desire for segregation, and all the various exaggerations that are not congruent with common sense and our understanding of people, in which we might assume that a person is motivated by something that they are not telling us, I would call such an effect an exageration assumption because it can often be difficult to prove that a person is sincerely attempting to sow discord or deliver propaganda from themselves or attempting to use another in such a fashion, or merely exploit a situation. Of course we know about false-flag attacks, and the way they can be used in the creation of propoganda, but we do not often discuss the idea of the hidden message propaganda where a false-flag is doubled, such as when something is presented as clearly being propoganda without it being stated and then given a second layer, being a false-flag, so that the hidden message will be found to identify the wrong party, to sow negative sentiments towards a person who might try to portray something so offensive with propoganda. Of course there is the concept of the person who does not know that something is propaganda, where the creators assume that the viewer will not agree with what they are seeing, due to how unreasonable it is, although there are some people who believe that it is not propaganda and conform to the message, or attempt to, not realizing that the propaganda was created to be disagreable, and in this situation possibly neither person is immoral, the person who disagrees in agreance with the propoganda creator or the person who agrees out of a quest for conformity, the later often being a younger person, if the propaganda is not too offensive. Of course there is the identification of another person, being the person who geniunly agreed with something and did not realize how disagreeable something was, or that no person, in some cases, was meant to agree with something, or think that something was normal or moraly acceptable, whether dealing with propaganda that is meant to be disagreeable to all, sometimes taken in measure by some, or something so disagreeable that it was intended to be rejected by all, and to in fact slander some group, and make some group look back, or give people a negative opinion of something. Then, of course, there are the exagerated stories that are intended to relieve the conscience of some by telling of something so despicable and inhuman that its occurrence, during thousands of years of history, only happened once, and not by most in a group, who would not have committed such a henous act. Sometimes, if something is bad enough, it does not matter if there are worse things, because the consequence is the same, and such, of course, does not change the definition of something, due the production of a greater degree of something. Appeals to nature, which seem to argue for a person's lack of sentience, appeals to a false-premise, appeals to the wrong concept for a situation, appeals to established truth but without common sense, are all suggestions of digressions from sentience, and if there are truly people who are barely sentient in comparison to people who are properly sentient, it certainly is not reliant upon IQ but seems to be in the realm of 'enlightenment' or merely wisdom, where we consider types of development that are expected for human beings who make decisions. Picking rare occurrences is of course attempting to establish a false-premise by displaying rare data, and picking the majority of occurrences can be attempting to establish a false-premise when it is understood, or clearly apparent without citations required, that such is not true for every case, or individual, being another digression from sentience. Of course we understand that justice operates on the established, standard, level of sentience and that committing acts with digressions from sentience does not alter that an injustice has occurred and often does not alter the consequences, although why any person should choose to make a spectacle of themselves before or after committing injustice, seems to escape me, for it's lack of reason. I have come to produce a proverb, which is, Do not say you knew it not when you have committed injustice when you were the person who denied the facts, and do not say you know it not when you have been found out, when you are the person capable of answering.
	The way that injustice is considered and justice, is part of sentience, and to digress from concepts that are part of sentience because they have been found in religions, or a religion, would be a fallacy which claims insentience for the person making such an argument. If religions have mixed basic concepts of sentience with other concepts, that are religious, than we do not claim to be ignorant about such a concept as mixing. Of course justice can be worded other ways, such as concepts of fairness, an honest standard, but of course the concept of fairness requires a person who understand sociology at a very advanced level, beyond the peremeter of interactions and occurrences, and such understanding has already shown to some extent that our sentience is not wrong, so long as it keeps with that morality that we know to be social, as opposed to anti-social, whereas we do not rely upon psychologists of any type to tell us what is moral and what is not, only the concepts of sentience that pertain to morality, since psychology cannot actually tell us enough, and we can understand that the disruption of freedoms would be more detrimental to people than criminal harassment, which is common sense.
	We can understand that some have greater obstacles and struggles and that good can be gained because of this, although the applications of struggles, intentionally, is often wrong, and seems to claim a broader knowledge of psychology that has not yet been attained by psychologists and sociologists. And so then we can also understand the concept of the blind disruption that's effects can be somewhat different that what was desired, since only rare goals are achieved with the structure of a program that is designed to increase struggle, and appeals to the wrong concept are again a digression from sentience. Of course, the concept of ect will have to be applied here, as we can continue to delve into the limitations of psychology and human calculation ability until we reach some exercise in something that does not have the effect of a title like Beyond Certainty but demonstrates that sentience is given to us, and that it is our only option, and that sentience walks with common sense, and is, in fact, common sense, as common sense is part of sentience. What is then being asked for is enough sociology knowledge to commit acts of real prophecy where we talk about prediction based on non-chaotic actions and their non-chaotic effects with regard to humans, and their psychology, understanding that different humans are different from each other, but all are encapsulated within our human psychology, or Our Human Psychology which begins to offer a replacement for a deity, the discovery of the Universe, or the exploration into the topic of God, as it pertains to Our Human Psychology common, and predictions based on our actions as they ripple out among humans, who are not the same as plants, rocks, etc, even if in some way animals are included within Our Human Psychology which of course would require more knowledge into the psychology of animals.
	If something cannot come from nothing, and there is something, which is a concept beyond physics, a high concept of science, logic, and truth, and a fundemental truth that is impossible to wave away with truth, than we can understand that there must be something more beyond the reality we have, in which science operates, then understanding the fallacy of over-extending science into areas it does not belong, where it has no business being, an encroachment by any application into the matter of faith and spirituality, and as such a contradiction, as science contains the logic to offer the contradiction for such an action, and we have people making a spectacle of themselves, but not as much for the confusion of so much scientific knowledge that has to be possessed to make the identification of such a contradiction, and as such, I have no desire to disrupt a tradition in society, only the lack of segregation is an error, at least for science. If there is something more beyond reality, we cannot say with certainty whether it is the God of the Judeo-Christian Bible, or something else, entirely, and groups that would claim it is, would likely be reliant upon the concept of prophecy through some type of psychic ability to lend more solid evidence that such is the case. Many labels can be used to explain what people believe to be the truth about humans and the structure of the Universe, being the truth that might be called Our Human Psychology common, and the sub-concious substance that might manifest itself into actions based on actions that might have been committed, or actions that were not committed, and how such substance might be documented by a common truth and portrayed in a larger scale, sociological, among people, or how the existence of matter, even reality, might indicate an after-life or a continued existence, if humanity is considered to be of value to some creator, whether a race of people, or a single creator, or something that cannot be understood within our paradigm of thinking, outside of the structure of our reality and truth, where what is truth in our Universe is in fact the creation of logic and truth for our Universe, since we can state that clearly something can be the case, outside of time, another creation, and part of reality, and that clearly something, by our reality, must have created something more. How we can possibly hope to answer such questions is presently beyond us, and relies on faith, not any type of science, but faith and philosophy and idle speculation to delve into the possibilities of origin, with imagination and not any ability to calculate with our reality. The clear truth is that what created must be outside our reality, and thus it might be almost impossible for something, a person, inside this reality and emerging from this reality, to attempt to grasp anything outside this reality. Here we are then speaking of external imaginings, perhaps not even metaphysics, which seems to indicate that we are knowingly attempting to imagine outside our bounds of reality and attempting to use our reality, and how we perceive it, to delve into what is outside our perception and reality. Of course understanding something, the concept I have explained, is not grounds for dismissing the human freedom of attempting to understand what might be, by definition, non-understandable. Societies look for other means to understand such possible truths, through the use of human psychology, in what is assumed to be prophetic ability that it is stated not all people possess, a psychic ability perhaps brought forth from understanding, focusing on something within a specific paradigm, for the ancient Jews, likely the paradigm of truth of Judeasm, or for Christians, likely the truth of both the old Testiment and the Christ, likely with an understanding of people and events that have transpired and a human understanding of justice and recompense for actions, that is attributed, in part, to what God will likely to do, going so far, as to what God even says about something and beyond to some extent.
	Certainly I will not disparage the abilities of empathy and what is possible, perhaps, when I myself cannot say what is possible to a further extent by the abilities of empathy and psychological ability.
	The Old Testiment's paradigm is called a 'pure language' and gives the psychological paradigm of an ancient religion that is still practised in various forms to this day, and has influenced our own vocabulary in the English language and even how we express many truths. Other cultures have used different paradigms and ways of expressing what they perceived to be truth that could be discovered with human ability, and many of these truths might not be in conflict with that of other religions, but then the decision for that concept is not in my hands, only I will state, that I believe truth can be found in every religion, and that human beings have used religions for thousands of years to convey understanding and truth that they perceived. It do not believe that everything found in every religion is true, which is not expected of any person, perhaps, although I believe that human beings are capable of descerning spiritual truth and that they have used religion to communicate such truth and still use it today, though not as often. The belief that religion produces violent spiritual war seems to come from a concept of protecting the core of atheism, since in some ways it is has re-emerged and in some ways it has emerged for the first time, and so must be defended more rigidly by those who would protect the core of what it is, much in the way a Christian preacher might confirm that which does not have to be stated so that followers of a religion do not digress, the almost tongue-in-cheek method relying on the concept of the fundementals of a religion, and not the more advanced items of a religion, or what is possible, all though I will not attempt to meddle in such things, not knowing what is right, and what is offensive and what needs to be there to mantain a religion, much like atheists might practise something that is not a religious practise, but a concept of reason in more rigidly defending the core of their ideas, being the absense of any diety, which is the only item of atheism, and thus permits all manner of spirituality, so long as a diety is not included. Early concern, with atheism in a fragile, early stage, may have lead many atheists in the past to more rigidly shun greater atheistic spirituality with concern that atheism could diminish and become disarrayed in the early stages if atheists more openly explored atheistic spirituality, and atheists have no commandment at all, much less a commandment against clandestine spirituality without a diety, to preserve their idea. Those capable of mantaining their religion while exploring items that are not disallowed or written against by the religion, might be considered those in the Christian religion and even Judeasm, who are not in danger of going astray, due to a firm grasp of the core of their religion while they move into terroritory that was never forbidden or spoken against, and is not considered evil by the scriptures that they understand, so that a more paternalistic, over-bearing, and highly protective parenting of such is not required, due to a more mature grasp of the core of their religion that they will not abandon, while grasping more truth and wisdom that is wanted for them, apparently, by the religion, and even encouraged by the religion, whereas others are said to be mastering the milk of a religion, whereas others are capable of keeping a firm hold on the basics, much like a University student in comparison to an elementary school student, or even a PHD student in comparison to a first year University student. First the basics of physics are taught, and then, when the student is ready, they are doing that which is encouraged, claimed to be better, more praise-worthy, more blessed, which is—not exactly challenging—but grappling to advance and find greater amounts of truth that are pleasing to the Universe, and in religion, likely, pleasing to God. Perhaps all that is neccessary is the desire for greater wisdom, hungering for steak, rather than the milk meant for the early followers, when it can be understood that the faith of a person is sound, and that they will not abandon the core of the faith when gaining more wisdom, much like the PHD student does not abandon the core of physics even as they grapple with new elements of the Universe. New followers can grasp for steak if their faith is sound, and how early it can be sound is likely based on the individual, but that it can be very early, seems to be understood to be true, and then the grasping for greater wisdom is likely a pleasing thing to God and blessed, as a person who is attaining a good thing, understanding humanity, and in Christianity, the Christ, who is human, and represents, at least in my opinion, humanity, being human, and embodieing and preaching those things that are compassionate and human, a mortal person who would be the conduit by obeying within the human capacity and the human measure, not even being all wise, and not knowing all, and not understanding all, but being a mortal and human person, compassionate and fullfilling the ways of the prophets and the commandments given to the neccessary measure for a human being, and thus doing what some had claimed could not be done, but by the standard of a human, it could be done, and was done by Him, and thus He became the atonement and conduit, because He was saved, saving Himself, and so by Him, we can have what He accomplished, and be saved when we did not perform the work.
	How is it then not possible that other people have conveyed truth through their religions that also might be respected as being true that we might not degrade ourselves and what we believe when we are of a different religion, by behaving like foolish children who mock and scorn what is good and right that others have discovered? Does God like foolishness? Does He encourage people to mock and scorn at wisdom only because that wisdom was not written in the main book for a religion? I will then offer the proverb that I believe to be for any situation, which is, Id does not accomplish the goal that is intended, but knowledge and understanding is for the person who would be stategic.
	I would mention that concept found in Christianity that 'God catches the wise in their craftieness' to be a strange concept to me, since such a discovery by God would be welcome, and then I assume praised by God, since wisdom is with morality, and that to carry out wisdom is to attempt what is good and right, and so I have considered that something may have been added to some of the letters in the New Testiment that do not seem to display a good understanding that is consistent with the religion that proceeded and is part of the religion, and what is true by our concept of wisdom and God's pleasure with wisdom. Why would the wise not want to be discovered and then have the help of God, as their partner in their goal, as if God did not already know what good was being attempted? But we seem to see a contradiction by some pointless imagining and misunderstanding of foolishness that we would call 'jack-ass' in our society, with regards here, to what the opinion of wisdom is, and such items are mentioned in the New Testiment in some of the letters, which seem to be in contradiction to the other items in the Old and New Testiment. Certainly the serpent in stategic, or prudent, as is the lizard, and both seem to have found favour with God, except the original satan who held the special place prepared by God in the Heaven, who is in existence by the proclaimation of the bible, to be fallen and gone from his place, cast down but still remaining in another capacity and purpose, to return again at a later time after the Christ has taken the initial children of God to Heaven. Certainly he would then practise anti-wisdom with his wisdom, to have been in the capacity to benifit God prior, and now to turn against wisdom, to promote foolishness and want foolishness with his wisdom. The devices of the original satan, who I will call Beelzubub, are effective, or would have to be, since they are those devices that are not devided against his kingdom, that I would assume includes the general personality types of the kingdom of satan and what they accomplish, the villians of the Old Testiment, each being identifying at times in present times and the heros of the Old Testiment, who are not actually at war with each other, if I am correct, and then the grande teachings of the prophets by this means, and the consideration of a person who followed the teachings of the prophets as well as the law of Moses, and you can imagine how large a religion the Old Testiment is, how foolish the idea is of turning the son against the Father would be, which is merely an expression I have produced, and the likelyhood that to do so would also be an effective device of Beelzebub and his general attempts to defile, dessecret, and maim in a sicophantic fashion, with all murderous impulse and hatred, that which is good, pure, and sacred, so that we would probably think of Beelzebub now, in his present role, as actually being more like the largest and most disgusting 'ass-hole' that is beyond our imaginings, something hideous in action, and disgusting in nature, that is so anti-human, so unworthy of sympathy and promoting so much foolishness and grotesque mutilations of humanity, that we would not speak of what he was, but the entirely different thing he is now, a new incarnation, of 'Beelzebub' who is despised and cast out, leering like a disgusting pervert that wants to hideously and horribly maim and injure what is pure and innocent. If this is not the satan of satanism, than satanism would speak of and write of an entirely different person and thing, by which we speak of two different people with the same name, due to what a satanist might consider to be slander. But if it is correct, in the Old Testiment we have parellel truths that have been committed to scripture, being true on multiple levels, I assume, sociologicaly, external, and internal, the later being the one which Christianity seems to most focus on, although the grander external, and the sociological, seems to still be honoured by the New Testiment, in which the Christ uses his own behaviour to explain the concept of what sin is, even showing that an exxageration in speech where He states that the mustard seed is the smallest seed (not actually the smallest, scientifically) is not actually lying since the person claiming that such is a lie by language communication would be a hypocrite who is guilty of the same thing, and that greater accuracy cannot be demanded of human beings, in the correct context, who rely on languages that are not rigidly scientific, but allow for exagerations, in the correct time and place, without being labeled as deceptive or false. Using concepts later altered by fantasy novels, like wizard (male witchcraft practitioner of ancient times) and unicorn (literally meaning one-horn and clearly a rhinosorus) do not lend credibility to the person basing arguments on such fallacies, and given that we are dealing with a religious text, the act of attempting to dismantle the veracity of a religion using science seems to be a scientific contradiction. At times attempts to protect the core of atheism become overly selfish, obnoxiously interloping, and encroaching although the tradition and freedom of speech does not seem to cause much of a hinderance to anything when the correct boundaries are being honoured that do not go beyond the right to debate. Of course where those boundaries are surpassed, whether by religious people or atheists, we have external, even financial attacks (when they are not supplied by fair capatilism) on the freedom of speech and exploration of law-abiding citizens on a planet which species is permitted to explore and speak freely about what they believe for the survival, mantainence, and free enjoyment of our species, that does not require any war-like mentality that looks to the future of our species in a stategic fashion, with an unauthorized, forceful direction, that is not permitted, in actuality, or ever wanted by a species that values our freedoms first and foremost, against those who would posit themselves as strategic war generals, to externally force people in directions they did not have to go. When such is not terrorism, it is still ignorant of the greater concept, with the exception of private institutions that specifically cater to one group's ideology, whether atheist or religious. Of course evolution is, in my opinion, the better option for scientific education, almost extremely necessary so as not to digress into the bias hands of religous people, but to remain in neutral and free territory where we can learn, without proffessing atheism or religion, and keep science entirely open to every person, regardless of their religion or lack of religion. Attempts to bring religion into secular education, or public education, whether in Universities or public schools, seems to me to be a foolish desire from those who are not viewing science for what science is and is meant to be, with attempts to encroach in an obnoxious way upon a place where religion, and personal faiths do not belong, and never should. Those who wish to blend science with religion, can do so outside the education system and are hopefully praised in doing so, being people like myself at times, who wish to explore in many directions, understanding that they can not likely have the endorsement of institutions that are not in existence to cater to religion, but are designed to remain neutral in accordance with science and what it is. Of course we understand that if a person wishes to expand from science into other realms of spirituality than whether this desire is manifest in the tentetive grappling with religion, or the spontenous production of new religion, or the tentetive grappling that must shun religion, when a person is actually delving into what they claim to shun, there is an encroachment that is contradicted by science by a scientist unless a person wishes to proclaim religion and depart from science into metaphysical science or some form of religious practise, as I often do, not being interested in operational science or the science of origins, being historical, but in metaphysics, spirituality, and the grappling with, appreciation, and interpreation of religion for the sake of my own curiousity and the curiousity of others, in a more agnostic fashion, while keeping with the religion I believe, although I have not found such beliefs with any person on Earth.
	Society, as it exists, even for politicians, is chuevanistic, in a fashion, or rather, in terms of society, it is indulgent and the bigger person, able to indulge and sustain the communications of citizens who then rise above constantly, and sometimes hypocritically, to condemn other citizens for practising the same explorations and freedoms that they too practise, much like complaining about complaining, railing against politics when you are a high-school principle, claiming the high-ground and reaping the rewards and kicking down hard, in a brutal and unjust way, that is not in aknowledgement of the rewards, or claiming the disadvantage, but not honouring the boundaries of those who hold a place of honouring the knowledge of that disadvantage, within their capacity to support that knowledge. The mustard seed is the smallest seed, and there is no lie, and to disallow, in hypocritical way, the explorations and freedoms of humans, being human in society, with proclamations that people are not being competely and utterly logical, accurate, or reasonable by the truth of the Universe, in a rigid and very wise fashion, is not in aknowledgement of humanity, and the greater truth, which is that society permits what it permits, as it functions and fluctuates, and some items are folly from the beginning, and unjust, while as most items seem to be the mere freedoms of society that once rebuked, will hopefully cease, although asking people to cease from some actions, is asking them to give up human freedoms.
	The Christ does not have to use such accurate language that he would be accussed of lieing, when you do not use such accurate language, by the definition of language, in that it is not inhumanely percise at all times, and is not required to be. Some are more accurate than others more of the time, but perhaps not always, and this too, is part of humanity, the challenging of which is like criminal harrassment, and overly aggressive against what is only human, when a person understands what a person is saying and the accussation that they are saying something else is only unjust harrassment towards them. Such debating is of course not argueing anymore, but a digression from communication, and a mere disruption to arguement and debate. Therefore I have adapted the concept to attempting lack of a hypocracy that is sometimes practised in academia and society when grappling with concepts that are incorrect, by offering an additional disclaimer, for the purpose of curiousity and understanding, in addition to any analysis of what is, being both the surgical philosopher, which is permitted, and a freedom, and the surgical philosopher who has identified the hypocracy, and even more when it is delivered in the incorrect context for that challenge to be used, being that the subject, a book or piece of writing, is the wrong 'time and place' for such a challenge to be used, just as a spoken debate is the wrong time and place for such a challenge unless there is a digression beyond the measure of communication for a debate.
	If you have a complaint about something, and then you commit hypocracy, you do not have the right to complain, and so there is no complaint anymore, and so there is no reason to be doing something, and you are the only person doing something offensive. Then you are the only person doing something offensive by your own proclamation of doing what you are doing and possibly by the proclaimation of others.
	Such is the nature of complaints when there is common sense and common sense would dictate that you do not complain and then purposefully do the same thing, which removes the injustice of something and makes you the only guilty party, being a perversity of truth and justice, where common sense is clearly violated and a greater foolishness proceeds, at which time the greater problem is apparent, as a person has exceeded the bounds of sentience, to carry out a greater evil than can be accomidated by humanity and, or God. Let not your hatred, I would state, permit others to commit such abominations and perversities of truth and justice in your sight, and do not stand with them, but remove such an abomination, and stand then with the objective judge, if you will reach to restore sentience to the situation, because if there has been wrong committed then common sense will be with justice and you know what the just recompense is, if there is any, and do not say you do not know, and you know what manner of just recompense is acceptable, and do not say you do not know, for the one who exploits evil and wrongs to commit strange perversities and wickedness is not to be the judge of any matter and must be delt with seperately and prior to any matter where wrong has been committed. 
	So I will give the proverb that must go with the paragraphs, which is, Do not allow the devil to judge or do judgement with strange perversities and wickedness, whether wronged or not, but remove the devil that righteousness might proceed as it should.
	But again I have noted how justice does not always proceed without the honourable judge, and that what is unseemly in the mouth of the judge is unseemly due to lack of sound truth and understanding, that the wrath of man is not for the lips of the judge, but the sound righteousness and truth is for their lips, and therefore it is right for a man to adhere to righteouesness in matters of ernest occurrence that it might be well in the future when the future is laid out for our societies reward, whether for the good or bad. Or is God and fool, and thus morality? But if morality is sound, and justified, than we will use what devices are on the side of morality, being the devices and players in the house of God, and not that which cannot be used by us, for the kingdom of satan is not divided against itself, and the devices of that kingdom are a harm to us to use.
	Why then do some seek to break the boundary of every truth after it has been stated, rather than withdrawing from wrong, to admit, with all dignity, that something is correct? But it truly is an abomination for a fool to depart from evil, even sometimes to the extent of mental illness, where established truth does not matter anymore, and can be carelessly dismissed for the aggressive attack that will break the bounds of reality to be continued by a fool, that another way is not even found by them, but the truth dismissed with a foolish saying, or a wrong argument, being truth that cannot be dismissed by any argument, not even in an attempt, that would signify mental illness. There is the belief that we cannot state the common truths anymore because the nature of many is to keep attempting to change things, to even attack, with the impulse to carry out some type of action, endlessly altering and blindly attacking, being that impulse that can accomplish great goals but devour truth and reason that does not actually change by the new found ignorance of people who speak of it, because the truth is absolute and unable to change for any person.
	If a person is developing, than allow them to develop, but to be steadfast with integrity against their attempt to devour truth and reason while they are still developing is not good for them, or for their future, and is not good for the future of others. If they should become radicalized extremists while they are still developing and learning, than their self-control should have existed to hault themselves at a specific line, and the consequence for them is not unjust. Then a person might imagine a person who is persecuted to a point of mental illness, where all they can do is lash out in defence against the unaddressed assault against them and you might understand the fashion in which a homicide can take place against a person, in which a terrorist is killed, and those who pushed them to mental illness and an extreme and desperate measure were really those who refused to help when they sought help, being the potential, and not always theoretical police who might not have been able to offer defence due to a justice of the peace, in Canada, who would not permit the police to help a person. Essentially, then, you have the matter of no investigation, and lack of consequences in a corrupt society, so that there is no investigation after the killing of the false-terrorist takes place, leading to the conclusion that a person would be better to be re-locate to another country, possibly, as a refugee, when persecution is taking place rather than become a killed murderer who was defending themselves, for we know the consequences, and that such is suicide and not an accident and not a mistake, but that there are localized events of corruption and persecution and that to take the foolish action that is wanted is to only let the evil win their battle, and all of compassion, of right, wishes for the good to survive when there is evil that is happening, that wars will be fought and won by Heaven, which will be victorious, and that a recompense will be there for those who do evil, that their lack of knowledge is not really possible if they are not something worse, by which to obscure their actions from themselves.
	Let them not censor the truth, when we know it, due to a belief in foolish people, and then let them not say that it was because of speaking the truth, when they know the blame is on another. But if our times are becoming more foolish, know that they are pushing through what they have wanted, and that they have not published the voices that would speak for reason, because no age is really an age of reason. Injustices have taken place and jelousies have been the motive of those who can find other excuses when they are confronted, that evil might committed again when they say I do not know of it, did not know of it, or it is because of something else, and their will is strong because of their rage and wrath within them, that their vision is small because of the walls of desperation that close them in due to what they believe to be an unfairness of life, because their paths have not come to make them grateful for peace, and peace is not enough for them, and neither is prosperity, but they have coveted what is not theirs rather than find their own portion, their eyes seeing the glory of others and never their own, and their destruction and downfall being from ignorance of what could have been understood. So Beelzebub does his work, carries out his evil task, and so the stoic understanding will consent, when the understanding is great, that the fight must continue, and yet the blameless is resigned, already having surrendered his spirit to Heaven, where it resides, because the endless anger of satan's children seems to have no end, and jelousy refuels them and replenishes their evil will, that in blindness they are bound to their master, and in blindness they perform the will of their father, being children of satan, and in blindness they receive their downfall, that the hell prepared for the rebellious angels awaits them, to swallow them whole, and their father, Beelzebub, will not join them in hell, but be saved. So is the reality of the war they fight, that the righteous have reason to have hope in their death, to be brought into the next life, and to know that the first phase was mostly for the second.

In the early years of a nation is a unity that cannot seem to be extinguished in some cases, and after this occurs there is the divide of many grievances, and loyalty and adherence to some greater principle, keeps them all from catastrophie and chaos during the most difficult times, that a reverence for something moral has kept them behind some impermissible line, and often that line is to be treasonous to what is considered the greatest treason towards that nation's patriotism, likely the actions of terrorism, that can emerge from corruption and great persecution, when in fact a person would be discussing what is more like a civil war in a local area and not actually terrorism for any ideological reason or even political reason, but mostly a fight against persecution. Do not push the people to such a limit and then condemn them, because if you do the prior, the later is upon your own house, and such is clear for reckless and foolish governments that are like a heavy burden and a foreign invader towards their own people, that their own people have been occupied by an enemy that resents them, that there can be only angst and the righteous united against foolishness and recklessness, that folly has come, and the light has faded from that place, and the hope for justice is haulted and extinguished early, being an attack against men and righteousness. We do not here see terrorism but what the terrorist feels to be the case for terrorism when they are ensconced in injustice that they do not desire, and have delt with incursions upon what they are, and what is right, that wrath is great for some reason, and it is because some justice has not been done for a wrong, and brazeness has spoken over the cries for justice and reason, and righteousness is not permitted to offer a recompense for what has occurred, and this is the realm that calls for zeal, and not always a youthful vigour to fight a war, but the situation in which wrongs have occurred that have not received a recompense, and truth is spoken over, and justice is passed over, and lies are spoken, and brutality is in the mouths of those who should offer remorse, that some have been pushed beyond the limit of humanity and some of these were offered poison for their good, and so pride has not brought forth a war, but injustice has, and if the war is to be fought by the desperate than terrorism is the only option for them, so that we will bring not the soldier to fight, but the reasonable to do away with injustice and brazen voices that seek to offer more offence and brutality, that we will scratch the tongue of the one who provokes retaliation and war, and cast them out from the role of ambassadors or where they are that they have provoked evil, that foolishness provokes and mocks, scorning and endangering, heeding not the just threat, bringing a call forth for fighting, and the war is not upon the one who has spoken this, and the original satan, Beelzebub, has spread forth his devices, the ones who serve him, within our midst, to provoke harm against those of us who did not injustice, that foolishness should go out that seems to be from us, and we do not act with wisdom when we have seen it, or speak words that would be resented, that are pleasing to God, and so the war has come, the innocent of ours were slayn according to the foolishness of injustice and brutality that injustice and brutality has been returned in greater measure, and if this is not so, how much more the evil and the disgusting act? For what do I know, of what has occurred, and what takes place, that the event that has transpired is upon me, and I have secretly sought to aid those who were attacked by my own people, and I do not know of what has occurred, or why there is wrath towards me on that day. But wisdom has hated arrogance and the way of pride without honour is for satan, that there is that time when death is brought to the meek and good because of the cruelty and evil of those who spoke for us, whom the righteous did not hold back and remove. Then it can be understood that wisdom excels and its fruits are good when they come, that we do not know of what evil we were saved from.
	Now then we have access to what we do not have to avoid, whether an atheist or religious, and that is the language of spirituality provided by the Jews, Indians, Japanese, Chinese, Europeans, North Americans, Persians, Arabs, Russians, Latin Americans, ect, and we do not have to, when we are outside of science, refrain from exercising such religous language as we please and as we are outside of science we may include psychology, religious language, the paradigms of different culture, all knowledge, all understanding, never required to impair ourselves by refraining, but having the abundance of the whole of the world and history, the whole of human achievement and knowledge, to be a people excel beyond what was before, having piled up the wealth of history, its spices and jewals of knowledge and understanding, it's gold, silver, great abundance of that which is pleasing and praise-worthy to God, that we are to be communing with all of the Universe, and with Heaven, in our great abundance of what we have at our hand, that the rivers flow and flood in their season, and the precious archetecture of wealth shines forth for us in the glimmering of the light, that prudence, wisdom, all sound wisdom is for us, that we might walk in ways that are good and excellent, to weild wisdom to our advantage, to recline in our given time, and to reap our great portions, and to admire the beauty of the wealth of world within history, that the shadows loom in their season of day, and the produce of the field is brought in from harvest, and we are to be abundantly wealthy whether we wander with no belongings, rich in knowledge and understanding, keeping the crowns and sceptres of knowledge and wisdom, or if we are at the task of diligence for the building of our society, loyal and disloyal, selfish and yet providing good for others with us, for our own cause and for their cause, acceptable and upright, and walking in the paths of our societies glory and the wealth that is for all. Let not the devil, Beelzebub, make his hell on Earth, with his hatred of humanity, for he despises peace and prosperity and he despises bravery in war, and he hates all that is good, pure, and noble, that he would place himself in his former image, to disparage humanity with his lies and the evil spirits that spread lies, that our abundance and our luxery, especially that is spiritual, is hated by him, and our building up of good society that is abundant and rich is hated by him, that he is puritanical  and destructive then of our portion and what is acceptable and praise-worthy to God, that he would call our good portions evil, with puritanicalism, to cast away what is right before God. Not a communist or capatilist, for he hates humanity, and all the good that it has, for he is base and disgusting, against what is good and right, against our portion that is pleasing to God, against our societies, when they are built up and successful, that is pleasing to God, to tell the lies that are with the evil spirit that lies, that God hates our excellence, that he did not boast at the Tower of Babel about the excellence of his small children, only fearing our destruction by some lack of diversification, or by plague and desease that would wipe us out in our early stage, and over-joyed as a father, to not articulate as well as He might, listen to me Lord God, my father, to your loving child, that he spoke then about what must be done, and the devil would use all such small occurrences, even small, to spread his lies against us and Him, that we might be decieved, that we might not reap the full reward, despicable and disgusting, is Beelzebub, but let us at least regard ourselves as better than him, even if mortal and imperfect. But the servants of satan are in many places in the Old Testiment, and still in the world, and the heros of the Old Testiment are to be known, and their stories appreciated, I believe, for their victory is to be had, and their life is to be immortal, being that eternal nature of all mankind, who is here on Earth in their first stage in preparation for the second, in which they might exist in a spiritual fashion, and able to recline in hidden realms to this reality, perhaps able to visit any place, existing as spiritual beings whose spirits might exist in many places, and so is the reward of consistency, a right path that is wise and prudent, an honourable thing that attains, that rewards are given to rewards, that life is to greater life, and death to greater death, that the path is one way and the opposite path leads to another, that Jacob valued the sentimental, and was not base, and his older brother considered the blessing to be worthless, and was only angered because of the loss, enraged at such a thing, but still not in keeping with a person who should be leader of a spiritual tribe, and so he is attaining things of this world in a praise-worthy fashion to God, while putting God and morality, and spirituality in obedience, first and foremost, that he is not a fool, and from him, eventually, comes The Christ, who gathers up those who are to be worthy by repentence, by guilt and remorse, to be going through the conduit that leads to eternal victory by Heaven, that wisdom is given for guidance, with common sense, and what occurs on Earth is even considered, that abstenence is not required, indeed anything permitted and practised in the Old Testiment is permitted, and only what is not is considered to be 'fornication' by the standard of the Old and New Testiment and what the greek word means, being 'sexual immorality' that does not even, from what we have read in the letters, keep a person from inheriting the kingdom of God, but that men who are behaving like a woman in their morality, when what is acceptable morally for a woman, is not righteousness for men, being what is often jelous foolishness for men to act out and behave in accordance with, and the traditional word, not to imply homosexual, but the word 'faggot' that is considered offensive in most places in the world, as a bigoted slander of homosexual men, but is essentially the word that we would use to describe a man who is 'like a woman' in their unrighteousness and foolishness, a genre of unrighteousness and even wickedness that is not found in any person who is homosexual or heterosexual but is considered to be unacceptable and is a person who is unrighteous that they may not inherit the kingdom of Heaven. Therefore, if homosexuals are capable of entering The Kingdom of Heaven, there Beelzebub, in his hatred of humanity, has sought again to seperate The Lord's inheritence from Him and has attempted to sow problems between The Lord and his inheritence in many other places, so that those who are against The Lord based on moral ground, are actually in His keeping and pleasing to Him, whereas many of those who claim obedience to Him, and yet do the will of Beelzebub, are the children of satan who are in the church, where they might be more strategic against The Lord's inheritence. Now a faggot is not someone who is precious or effeminite, whether man or woman, and these were claimed to have been behaving 'honourably' by the Old Testiment, but a faggot, or a like-woman man, is a man who falls below the standard of righteousness in their 'faggoty wickedness' being 'jelous faggots' and types of wicked fools, whose behaviour would be acceptable and sufficiently righteous for women towards women, but for men towards men, or men towards women, is considered to be wicked and even an abomination in its lack of good and righteousness, being a moral judgement, and not something pertaining to be weak, effeminate, precious, etc, which again are things that are acceptable and often pleasing to God, just as being strong, mighty, brave, are things acceptable to God, and the Old Testiment mentions such meekness, even the 'delicate man' which is portrayed, it would seem, to be a pleasing thing to God. Whether a woman desires a delicate man or a strong and more mighty man is dependant, of course, on the woman, and different people like different things. The sheer amount of disgusting and intentional mistranslation on behalf of satan's devices in this matter has brought forth most New Testiment translations to list people the Greek scripture does not list, so that a person might be better off to rely on a literal translation, that lists 'sodomites' which does not mean 'homosexual' but refers to wicked people who are violent in a fashion of being sicophantic, rather they are people who attempt to dessecrate in a fashion of strange wickedness, and 'like-woman' which I have already described, as well as those who literally pay for prostitution which would harm a person spiritually, although abstenence prior to marriage is not required and is not fornication, and fornicators are not unable to inherit the kingdom, although it would seem that the New Testiment does not approve, drunkards corrupt themselves spiritually, allegedly, and are thus harming themselves to a degree of unrighteousness, the coveteous are not minding their own business with regards to jelousy, and are often 'like-a-woman' in their morality, and rivilers, thieves, idol-worshippers, and extortioners, possibly does not require explanation. What God has brought together, let not man seperate, or the children of satan, who operate often in the church to sow problems between God and his inheritence, being The Lord who created humanity for himself, much in the way a person might desire to have children. Who then sows problems between a child and their parent, who is not considered a strangly wicked person? But there is that decieving, evil spirit which exists on Earth, and the hatred of humanity is unfathomable that is with Beelzebub.
	If a person has a prejeduce against homosexuals, or anyone, they would of course never stoop to mistranslating a religious text into another language because of that prejeduce, to fight for their social views, just as a person who had a grievance with someone might throw a punch, but would not fire a gun, and such is the case of men, who are honourable to a degree that there are levels they will not stoop to, things that are beneath them, and if such is the case with men, than it is assumed that the children of satan are capable of doing that which is not acceptable to a good standard of righteousness. In my youth there were people who believed that sexual activity prior to marriage that was hetersexual was to be considered 'fornication' and they applied such to the New Testiment, being Christians, as I have already alluded to in the opening paragraphs of this book, and as for the other attempts by many Christian churches to corrupt the scripture in favour of the will of Beelzebub, the concept of false-advertising is the accussation that there is guilt, whereas if the church were to advertise themselves as a different religion, not translating the Greek and Hebrew as accurately as they can, than perhaps there would be no guilt of attempting to sow problems between The Lord and His inheretence, as they would be presenting themselves as a modern religion, invented recently, and based on an older Christian religion, which in reality is actually the case with many churches, where the religions found are based on the original Christianity, but are in fact teaching a modern religion that they and others have recently produced, where they have added and subtracted from the original Christianity, more so when they have mistranslated, or claimed that less literal translations that have added and subtracted are in fact the correct translations to read, whereas the more spontaneous teachings of a preacher of some type are understood to not always be scripture and are designed for personal benefit and not to be accepted as the word of God. The reason I only choose Christianity when exploring and discussing religion in any essay or book is because I do not believe it is my place to meddle in any religion that I do not practise or was not brought up with, although I would imagine that my various views in some other religions might be of interest to some, although for the purpose of respect, when wishing to deal with religion, I would not publish any writing that features other religions. The more recent identification that shuns religion based on what many followers of that religion are, is not a problem for me, and I have wished for others to share my attitude of seperating a religion from it's followers, else, I too, might be anti-religious in some cases, although I have believed that people curious, and desiring wisdom on popular religions and what occurs in the world as well as wisdom in any area, can find further enlightenment in reading my indulgent essays, which are for the purpose of wisdom, in general, where it might be, in popular areas and less popular areas, being those things people might curious about, Christianity, especially, if a person resides in North America, or Europe, although I would assume that such can be of great interest to the curiousity of people who adhere to other religions in other spheres of the world, in which they might gain a more advanced understanding of a religion that many Christians, themselves, do not seem to really understand, while not disparaging Christians, but wishing to lend to them as well, such an advanced understanding, if they desire it.
	Then am I a Christian. By what such a label has become since the days of Christ, the answer is no. I am not a Christian by what such a label now means, in this day and age, but a person who ernestly, curiously, believes in the original Hebrew and Greek, that it happened and is true, and is not to be associated with any other person who believes such, since I am open-minded, curious, willing to explore, believing without judgement with regards to the scripture, and in many other ways, not a Christian, because of what that label means. Not all people from Neptune are evil, although the planet may have attacked, mercilessly, many times in the course of 2000 years, although I was never with the soldiers and only resided on that planet, and so I ask for your understanding in this matter as I live on Earth, wishing to be a liked member of society, if such is possible. Is it easier to explain why I am not like many others, or easier to simply say, “I am not a Christian,” which is now the truth, according to what has become of Christianity and what being a Christian means. But do I believe in God, and His son, believing the Old Testiment and the New without what is considered to be judgement, when we speak of the actual concept of being 'judgemental'? The answer is that I will not be associated with any person who claims what I claim, because I am myself, and not another, and I may be in contention with those I would be associated with, and so I will only say what is now the truth, which is that I am not a Christian, but I believe in God and His son, and as for who I am, it may take time, and my books might help, but I cannot offer more. I do believe that where there is hatred of Christianity, there is likely a good person and injustice that has occurred that is the real reason for such hatred, where a person is not of the attitude only that 'fair is fair' with regards to difference of opinion, because some justice has not been done for them with regards to what must be Christianity. Insecurity is not likely the cause for hating something, and not tolerating something that is likely to be viewed as innocent and harmless when injustice has not occurred that has lead to a negative sentiment against something. The evils that Christians have done while representing Christianity and even His son, are atrocious and unpardonable, being the false-flags of henously evil people who have even carried out much abuse in the name of His son, which is beyond deplorable, and really the work of the fallen angel, Beelzebub, being anti-human and anti-Christ when it is carried out with a banner of Christianity. If others would kill them, then let us give them crucifixtion that is just, which is the sentiment of cleaning one's own house, if it can be done, but of course we are having problems from the same people, and those who carry out evil with the banner of Christianity, are later and prior carrying out evils against those who are Christians, within the church, as much as they can be. Of course I am not in the church any longer, which is to say, I do not attend any church, except on special occassions, and I do not feel that I really belong in any of them, although perhaps some I enjoy on the occassion, because I am with my own religion, which has one person, and that religion has the original Hebrew and Greek, and I believe there are others like me, who feel the same, who cannot be associated with others under a common label. I have witnessed rare hatred towards me, or if I will write 'rare' perhaps the better term is 'with a few' and in another place 'with a few' who seemed to behave towards me as if I was Satan, not with any great evil, but no explanation, so that the concept of jelousy might not even be appropriate for its strangeness that seemed to contradict common sense. So please allow the new satan, ascended to the vacant seat, under the name Lucifer, not yet ascended, and not Beelzebub, to offer some more words on religion as I understand it to be, that I am for the practise of sharing wisdom and recieving wisdom with others in a benificial fashion, when it is wanted, and rely upon the curious to be indulgent of me, and the works I have written which are indulgent essays for the curious. I have wondered about nature, and its ability to provide wisdom, when not excluded with hyperbolic discounting, where those lessons that might be viewed by symboises and ecology, even the cycles of rocks, and seasons, which is not science, but is the act of taking lessons from nature that might serve as metephores, and whether the existence of scarcity can provide answers into the curtailing of some of the behaviour of people on this planet, when of course survival of the fittest is not against a person's own species, or an animal's, but offers that our status as fittest must be explored to our full potential, where we do not pretend to be less fit than we are, to be ignorant in our arragence, and claim to be so superior that we should view ourselves as being lower when we discuss nature, but being capable of understanding our dependence on this planet, as an intelligent species that knows when to curtail some of our attainment of natural resources, precisely because we are the fittest, who are intelligent enough to know when to take less. If animals not using their full potential are not likely to survive, than we may be dealing with a debate in a strange fashion when it comes to how we deal with the planet, driving up inflation so that we cannot curtail our attainment of resources and turning on our own people at times due to unexplored economic opportunities that might save us, and save our planet. If climate change is a problem due to the fragility of the ecosystem than it might not always be correct to cause massive deforestation in order to erect power windmill farms like the type found in many places in the North East rural areas of America, and in Southern Ontario, of Canada, south of Toronto. The economic cost on housing prices can also be effected by the deforestation and creation of wind-mill farms, and the government does not easily negotiate when they are forcing through a project that will impact the lives of its citizens, just as they have not always respected the megre space given to First Nation's People, the native population of Canada, when building pipelines that encroach upon their forest and land, especially when such populations do not have much land to begin with and tend to value the natural environment to a high extent, even ancient burial areas and the possibility of artifacts, so that the disrespect of building a pipeline through First Nation's Land can be understood to be a fairly brutal desecration and a dishonourable act towards a people group who have less land to begin with, and value progress, but would desire for such projects to happen elsewhere. The land is dwindling, and mining is even happening in some places, where projects have been approved to destroy mountains for gold in instances where already re-located people, who have been forced to re-locate many times, driven away in an evil way by Christian officials in some cases, and historically, some of them, being abused by Christian people, as children, are now dealing with further encroachments onto their land for the purpose of profit, as is the case with The Cree People, a First Nation's People group, who have been driven from location to location many times, suffering defemation of character by even more supportive newspaper articles that consistently portray those First Nation's People who become Christians, as being better off, often being alchoholics and abusive prior to Christianity, and changed for the better after accepting Jesus Christ as their lord and savour, the men being cited more frequently as abusive and often alchoholics, where alchoholism is not references as being caused by problems created by the government and the rest of society who are not First Nation's People, so that it can be assumed, at least by me, if I am to use my knowledge to take a guess, that when there are problems that require the aid of the government, being problems that are unjustly and wickedly targeting First Nation's People, there is possibly no help to be found, and if they defend themselves, they are considered criminals, and charged with crimes, like the Jews who were to be attacked in Babylon and not permitted to legally defend themselves, only the attack is legal, possibly a metephore for what the Jews delt with as unequal citizens in Babylon at the time that Ester was a wife to the King, so that I will use my understanding of the common evil of some people, and only guess that such occurs and can lead to alchoholism and abuse, or is a contributing factor, and that statistics might even be exagerated to defame a people group that must always be potrayed as being worse, morally, than than the rest of us, when they might be more noble in many cases, depending on the individual, and then add to that a liberal government, not even right wing, that disrespects First Nation's People as much as the conservatives, because for some unfathomable reason I do not know of, which no one has permitted me to know, these people are to be disparaged, not appreciated for the beauty of their culture and the wisdom that is to be found in their history and culture, but a group to be trampled when they succeed so that those of us who have not been permitted to know of why we are supposed to hate them so much can probably only know that our efforts, our support, is long overdue and more than right.
	Again we hippies, whether hippie or not, find ourselves the outsiders while evil is being carried out, as our protest is ignored, and again we are targeted ourselves as 'traitors' in a way, ousted a little to make way for the war, if not totally attacked with a consistent effort to ruin us. Such attacks cause incursions sometimes into finances, other times into priorities we might have had, but the vast majority of the time the greater incursions are towards those who are being attacked with the forces of a clandestine society that not all of us know about, that seeks to obliterate, and with rising sophistication of psychological strategy and tactics, so that a hippie is now ousted more easily in some situations where they try to identify what is happening, finding liberals where there are actually far right-wing people carrying out injustice against people, so that we seem to no longer stand a chance, and can any person tell what is happening anymore? No longer can hate crimes be proven, even reported, without the highly skilled defence and attack of people who are members of organizations that know at a high skill level how to deal with liberals, by pretending to be liberals when defending, and not in a callow, easy to identify way, hiding actions and obscuring motives behind multiple layers of cover, in which attacks create evidence that are used with another excuse, and then we have the planted bias, and the players who are against the liberal who might wish to take action, so that liberals are easily ousted, sometimes incuring financial lose, and other problems when they attempt to take action, while highly skilled groups, some with ex-military people in their ranks, do what evil that they can, for reasons they might never state. The level of strategy being employed against liberals during serious matters can be impossible for a good citizen to defeat, and if we are to also deal with such levels of strategy in the secondary level of politics, where there is the media, think-tanks, and political groups, than we might have a difficult time seeing through the fog of such an undeclared war in which matters become like nefarious and clandestine intelligence agency meuneuvours within our borders, and even the acts like disenfranchising voters, which is something we speak against, are only the shallow surface of the greater strategies being carried out in contradiction to democracy. Are citizens to be like soldiers and intelligence agency non-official covers in their abilities to sustain and practise democracy? The use of such strategies does not respect democracy at all, but knowingly seeks to use 'hacks' that are not computer hacking, to hi-jack democracy and the country to attain goals.
	At what time do illegal arrests come, with easy fraud, and prison camps for political dissenters? If we have seen such carried out prior in history, we might understand the sheer, real capability of using psychological ability and strategy, with the concerted effort of participating people, to carry out a partial take-over a country, that might at times be the case in a local fashion, in a way that is hidden below the surface of legitimate politics and official business. Imagine a city that is not really corrupt, but actually more controlled by domestic terrorists than by the official surface of legitimate agents carrying out lawful actions for a democratic system, and you can realize the local take-over an area that is not reported, in cases with First Nation's People, when they can receive no aid from law-enforcement, and also applied to every 'problem citizen', perhaps for political reasons, when an area in a country is more controlled beneath the surface by terrorists, whether domestic, or even in some cases, foreign. Such is not only possible overseas but is possible in areas where there is already a level of disarray that can be exploited for the purpose of a hidden take-over, if only temporary, by a foreign group or a domestic organization, that does not have the legal authority to do so. When a weak link shares intelligence with larger and more powerful countries, the unstable country will be targeted by foreign countries to gain intelligence from all the countries in the alliance, and if the neighbouring country is the real target, than merely be at peace with the neighbouring country could result in a country being the grounds in which missions and operations are carried out by an enemy of a countries neighbour, and such is the clandestine world of intelligence agencies and secret wars, sometimes targeting unsuspecting citizens, so that planted evidence, arrests of the innocent, false-flags that target citizens and seek to turn them against each other, deception and discord used against governments and ideas meant to further destabilize areas, groups of yahoos who are not really yahoos, attempts to organize riots, attempts to cause economic problems, and so on, are all elements that are understood by domestic terrorist organizations and foreign intelligence organizations, and of course the average citizen has little ability to defend against such actions. 
	At such times we only want to, and need, know one thing, and that is what the truth is about what is happening before we can make any decision as to what the correct opinion can be on any topic.
	At such a level, with such massive amounts of deception and multiple layers of deception there can be many who can no longer be considered traitors anymore, for they are citizens unable to deal with the situation and know anymore what the truth is, so that we can almost not even blame military personnel when they are deceived, much less citizens who are targeted by deception. Such a fog of war can be absolutely blinding, and can create blindness and lack of an ability to understand in every direction, and such can be guessed at sometimes when one merely considers the grand scale of politics where think-tanks, political groups, mid-level government, lobbyists, bribes, and corruption hide behind a privately controlled media that is owned by billionaires or millionaires, and a person might adopt a casual view of politics, believing they understand the grand scheme of things, or they might consider the grand strategies of hidden actors who move our society in a direction that does not honour democracy.

A terrorist considers terrorism to be an acceptable norm when the people do not. A terrorist considers another religion that the people do not. A terrorist perceives the world in another way that the people do not and the answer to that world not acceptable by the people. A terrorist was ignorant and their actions were pointless because they did not consider another way. Did we fail in message or was there already an incompatible inevitability, that would result by no wrong doing on our part, in a chain reaction that lead to terrorism? So is the problem a fundamental problem where the weaker side can only retaliate and fight our civilians and not our soldiers because they are weaker and thus desperate? In what areas must we do more?
	The topic of religious terrorism contains the various doctrines of religious groups and the idea that some doctrines in religion are then to be the doctrines that are sects that can be violent against civilians, and if zeolous violence in the name of a religion is not as much an anethema there is a greater likelyhood, to a certainty, that more terrorists will emerge from such spheres of influence than in comparison to other spheres of influence. We know now about the American militaries concept of 'blowback' which is when there is a retaliation for something that was not an injustice committed, and we can imagine that there are injustices committed and that regardless of the anti-Semetic over focus on the Israel and Palistine conflict, or the support of a region's nationalism that would include anti-Semetism as that which must exist, for some reason, for a people to attain their destiny, and the West is left with a strange predicament, where we know that anti-Semetism is wrong, belonging in the cult-arena and not just an arena of racial prejeduce, and we also understand that various countries within a sphere of influence seem to require anti-Semetism to promote their own destiny, which is not the fault of the Jews, and we can only do what is right, keeping to wisdom that is with morality, and not over-compromising in order to plunge the destiny of the West into obscure darkness by digressing from good and right values in which we do not compromise, so that we still wish to go more in the right direction and not the wrong, and must only then hope that we are not ever pressured to do the wrong thing as we attempt to refrain from meddling in the development of more fragile economies.
	In one sphere we have a people who are open to the concept of zeal, even if such violent zeal is considered to be lesser than the spiritual zeal, and so we can notice that is only inevitable that violent conflict will erupt, even in terms of retaliation, whether just or not, when this sphere of influence has incured military intervention, and thus we have a situation where negotiation is often bypassed in favour of direct military communication by fighting fire with fire which is the general method of discourse between two groups, the one being far more powerful than the other, and thus the other, more desperate, prone to targeting civilians, in what is actually a military battle or ongoing war where one side is prone to targeting civilians when they are unable to defeat the other side's soldiers. Attempts to label such conflicts as being for religious reasons is often the work of extremists groups after they have failed to win in battle, or are attempting to wage more war, where they are consistently attempting to hide behind their people group, and portray themselves as their defence, while constantly attempting to pull them into the extremist group's war with the West, that is being fought more for selfish reasons, being the pride and ego of the extremist group, rather than for the free choice and free destiny of those they are in fact exploiting for power and self-satisfaction.
	The extremist group is not good for them, and they are better for themselves and are more likely to prosper without the presence of terrorist organizations seizing control of impovrished regions in some cases, that are easily exploited, like violent bandits who offer a less than adequate benifit than the people would offer themselves with a reasonable and stable government. Attempts to sow discord between the West and impoverished regions in the middle-east are not for the benifit of the people there, although it would be stated here, that Christian groups, or Islamophobic groups that are against a local culture, should likely not be welcome to involvement in any aid efforts to stabilize regions and help a people govern themselves. Such problems arising from their involvement is not blowback, being a retaliation for no injustice, but the natural consequence of foolishness and disrespect that does not help anybody in the short or long term. When there is not a crises or greater problem for aid at some time, the work of Christian missionaries, if they are disrespectful by addressing Muslims as people who do not know better, or are uneducated in some way, does not aid the West or Christianity and only causes further problems, and so does any group that might travel to a primarily Muslim majority region, and offer a disrespectful representation of the West or of Christianity. Of course Islam and Christianity are both prostelytizing religions, and the continuence of such prostetizing is not about to be prohibited, I assume, at least not by me, who has no power to forbid it, anyway, although bigoted prostylitizing is not exactly spreading a religion, but is in fact the work of people with a desire to punish, for the purpose of positive feedback (psychology: operant conditioning: personal satisfaction) for themselves, and why they should recieve such positive feedback in carrying out such actions consistently would have to be determined—if it ever could be—by a psychologist who might explain why personal positive feedback is delivered consistently to such people, instead of guilt and feelings of remorse for attempting to disparage and mistreat people who are of a different religion, other than 'The Religion of Christian Punishment Towards Others' which I assume is an abomination to real Christianity. Of course positive feedback is part of operant conditioning in psychology and involves receiving a positive feeling from an action which serves to compound the behaviour, understood in addiction, which can often emerge from repitition of the behaviour until the behaviour becomes more consistently wanted by the person, where a person may have conditioned themselves to punish through repitition of such behaviour. Add to that the team identification that dislikes another team, and the desire to punish can be carried out by being a member of a religious group, in which some people might intentionally join such a group with the desire for an opportunity to 'punish' a people that they hate. Of course this disgusting action does not help the west and Christianity, and only serves as possible arguements for extremist groups to use in their recruitement effort, and more than that, it is morally disgusting and wrong to such a degree that it must be haulted as soon as it is identified. Moral people hate evil, and we know that such evil is an abomination and must be stopped, and we are in no way ignorant to how wrong such actions are.
	The various crimes of history are understood to be wrong, much like nuclear weapons dropped on Japanese civilian cities with the argument that such would end a war sooner, because Japan was determined to keep fighting, we know that killing civilians is not war, and that to drop nuclear weapons that will not only kill children to the elderly by the blast radius but also by radiation poisoning is not acceptable for war, just as it is clear that even Canada placed Japanese people in internment camps during world war II but not Germans or other groups, whether there might be Germans loyal to Germany in Canada, or Japanese loyal to Japan in Canada, since it would not matter if there could be traitors in our country, whether nuclear weapons dropped on civilians would end the war sooner, or whether there were Japanese people who would betray us in our midst, it would not make any difference, the acts were both extremely wrong, unpardonable, and not admirable for a country at war, a possibly demoralizing concept, unless you are a Japanese person who was poisoned by radiation and survived, or forced into an interment camp after your finances had been stolen by the government. Germans were not placed in internment camps, and neither were Italians, and although Berlin was carpet bombed by the British Airforce, the types of bombs used on Berlin would not have matched the destructive power of a nuclear weapon, and citizens would have known to hide in safer places from explosive bombs, where it was less likely they would be injured or killed, whereas the civilians of Japan had nowhere to hide and no warning.
	Or imagine the foolishness of films creating the impression of dangerous people with mental health problems, and then people of that type, but of a lesser severity, transfering such images and ideas to those for whom it would not apply, who have different mental health problems, and this by the people for whom it would more apply, and it is clear that when people spoke of 'crazy people' they meant something else entirely, but there are still some today, impaired in intelligence and thus desiring to denigrate because of their impairment, inferior and thus attempting to denigrate due to their insufficiency and lacking, who have chosen an ignorance that never had a real precidence, except among those who did not understand what 'crazy people' refered to, and have even gone beyond the old measure to attempt to posit such images upon new mental health problems that were not considered problems prior, and you can then consider that what all of those people were speaking of was probably the mental illness known as 'anti-social personalty disorder' and nothing else that is considered a mental illness and you might recognize the subtle irony or the great irony of such an occurrence, and how projection can truly be sub-concious in many different ways, and the fashion in which various people accuse from guilt and the innocent defend, and you might understand the vast amount of understanding that is already to be gained about humanity, that might go beyond the sheer understanding of the variable compensations that occur that can also result in some form of projection, or outward manifestation, where the sub-concious seems to be the substance of what is true at times, and yet it is possible that the sub-concious will lie about a person, so that we might not see proof of all in the outward manifestations of others, and this, too, might be common sense, but can we truly speak of common sense in all things, when the understanding moves into realms in which the truth of the Universe might be called into inspection, with a desire to know if people are governed by something, and animals, too, as I have already mentioned, and whether compensations and their manifestations that are outward are kept back by self-awareness, self-control, that such items, in this different way of thinking, might be an atonement for humanity to speak of some thresh-hold surpassed at an early stage, whereby those who possess self-control are often found with self-awareness and where one is lacking, likely so is the other, and that those who have both are fundamentally different than those who lack it, for even children, truly, have some greater amount of self-control than some adults. But here, again, I digress, and not with any great purpose in mind, only to state that the wealth of knowledge and understanding is from psychology and moves to the practitioners who are the psychiatrists and will the public, who is neither, and is not greatly interested in curious as laymen, or laypeople, then be the those who wield opinions that are more exceedingly ignorant about mental illness, even politicians, educated people, those for the science was not advanced so that a 'jack-ass' or person being foolish, might wield such advances in an inaccurate fashion that is in the opposite direction of the truth on the matter? How is then to be called any advanced thinking that practises brazen ignorance in the name of a science that is not understood, but because the word 'crazy' has been with us since the beginning, we are at the knowledge level, in society, of very ancient people on the matter, and then the common people, and are speaking about that which is far more advanced and including more than what any ancient people would have called 'crazy' during that time, for they were not ignorant of the temporary nature of mental health problems, just as they were not ignorant of soldiers returning from war, or long winters, or being spiritually ill, or the effects of isolation, or the effects of mistreatment, being less ignorant than our common people, in many cases, and this moving counter to the direction of knowledge and understanding in science. Obnoxiously citing the worst atrocities in history that were iscolated to one country for a short duration is of course a disgusting and perverse fashion of addressing any problem, and claiming anything either than an injury to one's own character and claim to any intelligence, even respectability, and if such requires explaining, what is the point of explaining it, other than for myself to contradict my effort? But the mental illness of not being able to properly perceive reality and the effects of actions is present in many, not debilitating enough to warrant a diagnosis, and it is understood that the sane perception of reality is that the one who mocks and scorns makes a fool of themselves, and not others, the one who speaks in a disgusting fashion is viewed to be a spectacle of foolishness, and the one who denigrates with disgusting references that are passive aggressive or openly hostile, shows themselves to be a foolish person and perverse in some fashion. Why passive-aggressive people should believe themselves to look less the foolish spectacle when they denigrate others when there is no sufficient cause to do so, is still beyond me, and I can only attribute it to the mental illness that brings about a slight impairment, being that lack of self-perception that does not debilitate enough to qualify for a diagnosis. So with what curiosity I have into such matters, I identify all the ways every person seems to have something wrong with them in terms of mental health, but never those that I like, because my scrutiny seems to be for those I consider enemies, and them I do not truly hate, at least not often, whereas with others I am in more neutral territory with, extending to those I like, I find I only mind my own business and appreciate them, for my own pleasure. So is the poem for these who delt with a dispicable time in history and only 80 years ago when they were alive, and perhaps still to this day where fools are not sufficient in some fashion, within themselves. A person might think of educated people capatilizing on the phobia of a person who is frightened of what they cannot understand because they are not familiar with it, and thus believe it to be more dangerous, or unpredictable, than it truly is, and are thus given to despise what they cannot understand. The present does not need to given any kind words to the past, at times, unless they wish to be judged by the sins of the father, for there were dark ages in specific areas, recently, and an ignorance and exploitation of other's brutality and ignorance, so that it might be understood that some of the most henous and dispicable things have taken place in recent history, part of world war II, and the Nazi Eugenics attitude, and yet not officially connected to such, but happening in other places, and not with the education of modern science, but with advanced knowledge, and a direct opposition to that knowledge, to carry out human rights autrocities in North America, Europe, and other places, so that in the sixty years since that began to fade, we are still living with some of the outdated sentiments and science of early attempts to grapple with variable forms of genocide, mostly towards the Jews, which might be explainable by the impulse of some people to carry out mass destruction, possibly emerging from sub-concious perception of self defilement within themselves, that they direct in an outward fashion at the world, in inappropriate ways, and with strange associations, indeed any association that might be available. Or they are rapists, and the woman they raped is suffering mental health problems, and so they wish to wipe out all mentally ill people, the later being sometimes considered with people suddenly very concerned about mentally ill people and the problems they might cause in a country. The self-cleansing cult of Eugenics people, that I consider them to be, is that cult which recieves positive re-inforcement from the self-satisfying sense of cleansing themselves by cleansing the planet from what might or might not be percieved as the real problem. Clearly this does not include the mainstream domestic terrorism that sometimes is found in areas of North America, but a more niche part of domestic terrorism, that can be explained by understanding humanity and its various misunderstandings of itself.

Considering all circumstance that is beyond
the still crossed yard, and beyond this time, 
depleted of temperature, cold to hot, 
and still out of touch with temptations of sanity, 
cleansed here beyond, 
and in the cool floor is sketched all blemish, to contain 
collamity that lists
and leans 
into a serpintine day-dream on the way, and 
the way to hell is paved with 
witchcraft, sorcerer's blindness bound up in 
blankets and concrete walls that held aloft a 
clock for you, and same undone with declarations 
of insanity beyond, beyond all histories 
repititions that heard the known fuse that 
clicked and held the gavel that judges you down, 
to know that no knowledge requires you 
to make blameless, to justify the 
fool, unless 
you are the same, 
but vanity, of foolishness, a vanity now, 
to save your own mind from any agony, 
that justice reaps nothing with you, fallen 
class-mate, undo demon, to all the world is gone! 
Here now all the Earth is forever washing people 
towards the ledge and the door, that 
dreams of whimsical paper in the wind 
and the tile, where temptations all 
are scared with blame, that winter 
comes around and empties all the 
tombs in the graveyard, where nameless people 
tend the way, all anonymous to lower gods and 
known for all their obscurity and sense of 
sensibility where nothing is concerning them, 
that clocks will proclaim that they have 
their ill on Earth by nothing, 
empty charms and vessels 
burned and brightly set asunder all the rows.

PART III: HEAVEN AND EARTH 
	
What more is there write about religion and its truth and science that is objective truth and common sense, that all is based upon, without which everything else fails? Without those who mantain innoccence the Earth becomes a waste-land, and the time is vain, the world is changing, the present world is fading away, and yet by truth it is not, and is burning brightly, that hell might indulge the false prophet who is the prophet of the devil, who decieves humanity and attempts to and attempts to sow problems between His people and inheritence, whether the Jews or the Christians, or those who are not either, and attempts to sow ignorance and foolishness, and attempts, with his devices, to encroach where he does not belong, that he seeks what is wrong for every person, whether they are good or bad, that he is worse, lower than all men and women, pulling down to the depths all those who are above him, being all, and his servants are lower life-forms to every person, and if it were not so, I would not understand it, that there is the person who is a lower-life form and there is nothing that can be done about it, for the devices of satan are his children, and they are in the world, and the anti-Christ spirit is in the world that goes away from Jacob, that is found among the worst villians of the Old Testiment, that the Jews are not meddled with by the Romans for the decency shown by the Romans in one matter and their brutality in another, that was carried out because they were not the kings of the king of the Jews, who was percieved by David, a prophet and able to percieve in a fashion that seems exceptional so that the Christ would come from his line, and why he should emerge at a later time, after David is not surprising by intuition, but remains not totally understood by me, although what would have to be fullfilled prior to his emergence is also unknown to me, and so perhaps I allude to knowing more than I really do on this matter, only he seemed to have emerged at a time when Israel was in control of another Empire of non-Jews during a time of great power for that Empire, and as He fullfilled the prophecy to become The Christ, He was capable of attaining a victory for the Jews first and foremost and then for all people, because it is not fair, or right, to not give priority to those who have laboured and suffered for God, and do they not incur persecution to this day? But He was tempted many times to sin, was tempted to sin and commit injury to Himself in three different ways when He was fasting in the wilderness for forty days, and He fullfilled and passed all the tests of a man and all the law and prophets, and became greater than seems capable of articulating by forgiving humanity on the cross, because, as He claimed, they knew not what they did, which is not a greatness I have or attain, but seems to be extended from Him, and perhaps then even to me, and others, if I will be a hypocrite, but if they truly did not have malice towards Him whom He forgave on the cross, I will only believe it because He said it, and not from the proclamation of any other, for it is to be understood that such is none of my business and of course I cannot meddle.
	Now, of course, to cast out the child, is not to in any way cast out the Jews that the gentiles are the rightful heir, because this is not understanding the story, and even history, but if the story is to be understood, it happened for both Jews and Gentiles of any ethnicity, and if you do not understand it, perhaps you are blessed, or more accurately, lucky, not to have met my many jelous older brothers. The Jews are circumcised in heart, and it is not true that they follow in action but not spiritualy, but it is dependant on the individual, and I, personally, have found the vast majority of Jews to be good, and not possessing base faults, because as the new Satan, Lucifer, and not the old satan, Beelzebub, who will return to Earth as a man, allegedly, later, it is my partial hobby to bring you this knowledge. Now as for the Jews, it is perhaps better, given what is against them, that their enemies should not know what to say about them, only they have been slandered with everything, and they are evil without cause when they only do that which is common for all us, and what is against them is not like a problem of ethnicity, but contains religious matters and even spiritual, that the hatred against them belongs also in the cult realm of hatred, where they are viewed by the evil of Beelzebub and the deceiving spirit in the world, as being satan, and not accussed and attacked by satan, where the New Testiment is considered and the cosmic struggle is considered by many anti-Semites who are deceived by satan when it is anti-Semitism, to do that which is against God, because why would righteousness be against what is rightoues or good, and how strange is the device of satan, who has that evil persecution towards them, that some of these anti-Semites, who are giving evil for good, when there is no injustice, are then with Beelzebub in their actions and are like something from a horror film, strange and creepy devices, who degrade themselves by bringing evil towards what does not have wrong against them. Do people, all people, not know that we do not bring evil against the person who is committing no evil, and we know what is acceptable, and so by what spirit, if it is not of God's judgement for right and wrong, does a person bring offence against another, if there is not evil being committed or something that would have a cause for contention? But the spirit is of Beelzebub, and the deceiving spirit is there, that this spirit might give motive to those who would bring evil against the Jews when they are not doing anything that would bring contention. Why is it good for a people and how they are to be considered, to be doing the work of Beelzebub when they are given the kingdom of Heaven by the Christ, to only be deceived by Beelzebub, and not to their own good and credit? But truth is benificial for wisdom, to know what the truth is that a person not become inconsistent to a degree of hypocracy, so that those who persecute the Jews might cease from such actions, not being considered unworthy themselves of God, and being His inheritence, also, if they are willing to receive His gift, it does not seem to be seemly for such persecution to be carried out by them. But is has been considered by me that what a person does to themselves they are given the impulse to do to others, and when this occurs, I cannot say, and in what spiritual ways this might be true, I cannot say. But if a person has rejected what is good within themselves, a person refusing to follow God in some ways, in what ways will they be inclined to carry out evil against others? Now concerning the King of the Jews, is it not their private business, where we do not meddle, and are not capable of judging, knowing that God's work is God's and that He was with His people, that some things had to happen so that we would have eternal life? But Rome did not fail to perform the task that crucified Him, and if there was truly no malice in the Romans towards Him, than perhaps they did not know, truly, what they did, only in what ways are you to be hypocrites, when your sin also has been the cause of His death, that He had to die to make a way for you to eternal life. Inconsistence is not with wisdom, because wisdom is always consistent, as the scripture has alluded to in the New Testiment. Now if a people did not follow His ways and thus acted in time, for Him to be killed, than is that not a private matter among the Jews, that had to occur so that they too might have a victory that is for them? But here I wash my hands of it, not having committed such actions myself, and not able to be a judge of Him, to save Him, because He is the king of Jews. Now if I have intervened it was because He fullfilled everything to the full measure for the standard of a man, and did well to the fullest measure, that I have moved to abolish the lies brought against Him by Beelzebub, after the Christ and the man, has fullfilled his suffering and duty on Earth. So here is my Bible, being part of The Diary of Lucifer and my personal notes, that I have my religion, that is not to be added to the Old and New Testiment, that has no followers, that I am not to be worshiped, that I have then a diary in addition to this diary, and so, perhaps do you, for the sake of curiousity and the sharing of wisdom. For those who documented His life said when He was being tempted, and they claimed other things, that we might know, and so I perceive that there was no intention to do wrong, but that is not known to me and I cannot speak for God, or for His son.

How many times did the children of Satan tempt Him to sin with His mouth, that an evil spirit on Earth might portray Him to be something else than what He was? But where they have tempted Him and tested Him with pressure He survived to lay down His life, the pure lamb and a man who was human, speaking without guile, but truth and the enemy has brought lies to His mouth because of the children of Satan. He spoke truth and good and the Romans put vinegar on His lips and those who came later put lies. So they knew it not. Who He forgives I cannot blame for they have done Him wrong and He has surpassed me. Let one who is tenderly loved by Him offer what he can and give back the truth to those who did not intend to go astray from the literal words of His lips when He avoided their traps. For the woman who is no wife is put away by God if it is so by a man if the man then agrees and attains a certificate of divorce it is then that the break or divorce is made and not prior when a man does not do this thing. The woman is his wife and love is exceedingly patient that it is not an easy thing. For she divorces wisdom before she is put away. Let not the imposter attempt to bring the pure to hell, and drag the Lord’s kingdom down with her to that place of fire and sin. Because of the Lord there is that which never was and the man is keeping then to God, and his wife is another, because he is truly alone, with no wife who truly is for him. But blessed is a faithful woman whose beautiful spirit is preserved in Heaven.

The king of the Universe, only second to God, is left to be killed by His people, and not saved by those who are less than Him, for they withdrew and performed another’s will because it was not their place to save Him and meddle, although they found Him blameless. Neither could Rome save me, but more so me, and they could like friends, because I am not king of the Jews. Then Rome should know of God’s love, in my opinion, that Beelzebub is their enemy, also, and as they have respected God they do not wish to meddle with the Jews and what is theirs.

The one who attacks from jealousy loses what he has and then even more in what measure he attacks, but reliable wisdom is with the righteous.

A fool attacks when none accuses, but a man of integrity who is faithful is secure.

The one who knows their own wickedness has failed to understand, but the one who rebukes themselves is with understanding.

The one who comes later and challenges an alpha without cause, and they will not be at peace with another alpha, is like one who would scatter the people that they would be destroyed, but a prudent person will value peace.

What is watered is maintained, and many rewards are with God, but there is an inconsistent person who degrades what they have and themselves.

The beauty of a good woman’s youth is sealed in heaven, but a wayward woman is brought to ruin in truth.

The one who takes good without permission and offers no good in return is not without debt by justice, but honourable men dwell with the glory of a righteous kingdom.

Something does not come from nothing, and so the existence of more is self-evident, but the standard freedoms require no diety.

Following all the paths, meeting the measure of the laws, and what attacks can only ask to pass through what defends, and so let the accuser be labelled honestly, that what they have is surrendered to the one they attack, to know that I too am the way, the truth, and the light, and those who are for me receive from another. I do not claim then that I am the Christ, but offer a disclaimer because of the blindness.

Those who fight a spiritual battle are judged by what they do, and not by their claim, and God is not turned against his commands and judgement.

A daughter beloved by her father, consistent and never wayward, beautiful by wisdom with beauty of her youth preserved in heaven, cherished by the Universe, immortal in heaven and a crown of her husband, possessing grace and good gifts, preserving that which would be immortal.

In what image is a woman preserved in heaven when the beauty of her youth is preserved there by her good? In what way is love preserved there when love cannot perish? Will the Lord who cares for people cast away anything of true value that is both on Earth and in Heaven? For we look to God to save us to immortality, to His son to come down and rescue us with a heavenly atonement, that we might be immortal, and that our true items of substance might be saved from the destruction of death. Can even wisdom do this thing? Can any prophet offer the atonement? But I have paid a price because more was not told to me, and the word was not sufficient because I did not know it’s secrets, and did not obey as well as I could because of more wisdom that I lacked that was not told to me. Certainly there is one who attempts to be foolish and abandons what wisdom they were given, and not the one who seeks the pleasures of a world but the one who wants war and chooses the wrong battle for themselves that they might impair themselves and have less, casting away and losing and even attempting to cast away the good that others have spiritually, and this is not consistent but wayward. The one who seeks foolishness seeks impairment but there are rebels and the rebellious in the keeping of God. High or low, superior or not is of the individual, and the secrets of the Lord’s people is kept, only good should not be kept from good when it is God’s will. The just recompense is even God’s that He is glorified even by the spirits of men so that Heaven and Earth might commune on Earth. I am not to be worshipped by men and the kingdom is the Lord’s. If there is more there is a son of God and I would want Him to say, let none attempt to divide you from me. Can good be done without the evil? Can what was committed and what failed be fulfilled? But I perceive that the priority is with His son and the power to fulfill is with His aid and way.

I cannot be made of money, less I be sick, for money will not enter, and God has made it so. Has God not given his commands? But I am the Lord’s first and foremost.

If you have tempted the son of God to speak evil and He gave you truth, know that He gave you no lie and died to make a way. Now the one who has made me possible is the one who delivered you, and my words are possible because of Him. A man cut off from riches will likely lose all, and yet I belong to another and not to money. There is a stubborn son who is obeying while the obedient is in the grip of the devil, and so let me then inherit more, that I be loved in the later end. For if He answered you here with what seems like guile, know that it was with understanding and the greater kindness, or so is my opinion because I do not speak for Him, but no loyalty can be to me if it is not more to Him because his right hand is Him and what is given and is good is from Him to you. Now is a man being human and given language able to do more or are you to be a hypocrite? What can be said that is right with language because if He did not sin, neither do you, and is He not human to show the measure of obedience and what man is capable of? But He has made Himself a little lower than the angels to come to Earth to be human and fulfill all the obedience of a human man and to be an example of such. Now do you perceive Him here as not Human but the son who has not lowered Himself to be one of you. Even more so then than you, He is human and a man, frail and suffering like a man and suffering more as He was killed as a man who bore His great hardship. Will you not then pity Him and pick Him up as another man? Or is He to then suffer on His own without help? But would you prefer an angel not yet ascended to a mortal man like you? I would not let you be deceived by any evil spirit that dwells on this Earth and so I wish to speak the truth.

Does the sub-conscious manifest itself in projection when it percieves that it—the person it is part of—deserves to be punished or eradicated demanding what would eradicate it? But let not those who cause the righteous to sin with any evil forcing of sin, where it is not the fault of the righteous, believe themselves to be blameless, because inconsistence is with those who do this, and a great inconsistence, that they have destroyed themselves prior to doing such towards the righteous, that they have molested themselves and made themselves exceedingly warped and crooked before they did this thing. So the just recompense then brings them lower to hell than that of a man, tied by the feet to a heavy mill-stone, brought lower than the furthest depths of the ocean, that an abortion is better than these, and it is better for them if they had never been born. For when does an animal do such a thing, and what fool is attempting to perform this? But a self-mutilated fool who receives worse, later, is utterly destroyed, and what more recompense can be done to that when it is close to not existing? But such is like a physical soldier of Beelzebub on the Earth, that they might perform a violent attack upon the psyche, being what they call the spirit, that such might be abuse, and is it not so by what God considers, that God cares greatly about, and He knows what it is, and how evil and wrong, and will He not have exceeding power to be against that which attacked His house and his child? But a father who gives evil when good is sought is no father, and God, in Heaven, created all the Universe, and loves His children greatly.

The ground is cursed for your sake and society is also. Why then does any person call for that which is not good, but beyond the limit?

When you separate the sheep from the goats, or rather, the good from the evil, not in terms of religion, you will find there are more good people. Let no ideology or belief turn the good against the good.

Story of Lucifer:
The child who needs parental attention is found in recklessness, calling out against the one who cannot help, the younger of siblings, and the eldest possessing much virtue, but such attention is not always easy, and so a good parent will work to the child’s betterment, that all manner of beneficial gain might be for them. For I am an only child, and was, having no sister, the son of one who did not teach any foolishness or prejudice, indulgent parents and not pressuring their child to be something he was not. And the wicked attempted discord who might envy the father while keeping their tongue while their attempts were thus directed against the child, who was like the only prince of a place. How then were there actually other princes I did not see? Loved by others and at times annoying, receiving favour and patience of others, I was to pass through and become more of what I was until I had taken a firm hold. As for that child who must inherit their portion, I do not know of what all should be done because the rest of the words are for another. So is the phase of a man, that all wisdom is not for one to speak and so who is to say who understands more? But the wise man has understood much and is great by it, and speaks more than the angel who is tenderly loved. How is his glory then on Earth when it has understood so much, and the angel cannot say and will not easily bring an ill report against him to God, for he is like a great king on Earth, whose works are good. Now what is God’s will and what is the will of a great man and how will injustice then be wrong for all? But the judgement of a man is dwelling with the truth of the Lord, and the judgement of a true king’s lips is not in error when he offers his true judgement without deceit. For the great man is a great wise man and the king whose throne is established by righteousness cannot be spoken of badly by the angel even when the angel is beyond him in ability. But truth is found when it is truly kept with truth that the advances are based on truth and the spirit of righteousness perceives many things. It is much more difficult then for the angel to bring a bad report against one and not another.

The report of an angel:
Homicidal sicophants have attempted to crush the young who are innocent and no person kicks at their shins, so that the evil are truly to be lacking in the greatness to protect and even parent, that the younger is taking charge of the kingdoms, and because the younger is preferable they are unable to do rightly by them and pressured they lash away from what is right to degrade themselves by attacking the younger. So a new thing is emerging that does not inherit the sins of the parent, and it is my belief that they are parented by God. For there is a parent who bullies and will not care for their children and they offer bullying instead of correction, and even insults to the innocent children who are looking to them as parents, even more so, sexual harassment to their children, and in some cases fathers to sons, which is a perversity upon their wicked lips, and death does not swallow the wicked, and no hand of judgement protects the child, and the corruption of drunkeness is even upon some of the wicked who do this, without drink, and so the angel will make inquiry, so God has known of all that occurs, so the mighty who are in heaven are brave, and the cowardly are looking to be shown mercy, even then despising themselves, that they might not depart from evil, the way in which self-hatred does not cease to awake from insanity and foolishness, saying, “I should probably cease, but I hate myself,” and so is their heart, that they hate themselves and some are finding even sympathy and pity among others who are like them, who hate themselves, and find more self-hatred in their wickedness, that the evil they do to the innocent who are younger is not unknown by the brave hand that holds a sword of fire, for the throat of a coward is unprotected, and there are less righteous upon the Earth.

They are impaired and seeking to impair others, but an upright man who regards fairness and justice is for goodness.

The one who gets is secure, because of his open hand, but a wicked king will be a king no more, when he covets what belongs to those whose possessions are far less. So it is not reasonable for a king to be jelous of any of his people.

The one deceived by satan has hope in revenge, that the Lord is mighty and His son has won the victory, but degredation is to the one who becomes a device of satan.

Sometimes the only way is not as they have claimed, but where knowledge is lacking the strategy might fail.

Foolishness claims it possible for a person, but by truth the answer is no, but a wise man procures favour from God.

Righteousness does not fail, less it turn to something lesser, and yet there is one who does not act, who is doing what is more pleasing, and one who does not act, with whom wickedness is found when he has been demanded to speak truth.

If a person would not know, and you will not tell them, then why why does a person complain about their mistake? But a just balance is for the wise.

Egypt and its glory have chosen God after the coming of His son, and were they not better before and not because they did not have God? But the glory of Egypt is spoken of in metaphor and those who made it originally. How then is so much scattered and yet by virtue and good it re-emerges to be seen as better. Now what sin would cast what is pleasing to God away? For when a person does what is good and pleasing to God there are lines an enemy will not cross when they are a man or at least good enough to be a human. I do not wish to be against God who created all, and how does it benefit to cast away my own credit to be against God? But if my riches are with Heaven than I do not desire to be against God. How is it then that Egypt is gone and a people are scattered? Now there is that which comes to pass before good is attained, and I have seen sin seek to do an evil against God knowing that the devices of Satan have before said attain well and they are throwing attainment away. Now what is done in secret will be known and God is not being against God that with the righteous the good is being promoted and yet the one who is fulfilling good is sometimes having more opposition, whether being the Roman, the Jew, or the Egyptian and you have known who it is when it is true. Now the one who steals is not despised when they are made hungry by war against them, and the refugee being persecuted has gained help from criminals. But you are using false judgements in those matters where you know the truth? But the one who has food does not need to steal, so that you might not believe that I justify the wicked, and the one who profits by robberies is not one of the people in their plea for righteousness towards God. But let there not be, at least, those who would be the devices of Beelzebub to separate what God has joined. Now what man of intelligence uses his understanding to ask those questions with his understanding that would defame the righteous when it is the time and place of another to answer without sin, and then the place of the one who would be more loving in a topic, that such is the realm of him with his greater love in this place, than the one who is to abstain from something for a greater purpose. But a nest of foolish vipers with foresight have despised the angel and being a man of much love for women he has sharpened his sword in its extraction that a man in this fashion will not tolerate them and their words will be meet with more than is their place.

The servant follows their master around even the servant of the husband of their master when it is so, and this being a type of perversity on Earth, but a wise king is keeping his people back with rebuke, and a leader who is noble is respecting the good man who is not of his people, that equals are at peace and some servants are rebuked and despised.

The burdens of a prince are unknowable by the one who would be put aside to be their partner’s servant, but the virtuous daughter of a good man has before in this world been married by an angel.

The nobility of these wise goats has caused the angel to yield, the lion to be his friend and comfort from the tiger, and now then there is what is more, being those he created to be his children, that I am kept out, that I cannot judge those who are belonging to the son of God who saved them, because all of this is exceedingly great so that the angel of much ability has said I am an angel but not as great as God. If there is more, than your children, my God, are with affection even for the lion and tiger which the angels do not know of, and it is well by both when acceptable, for the people are your children. I have never yet scratched the belly of a tiger that has offered me comfort, that is belonging to the Lord. But your children are not like me in all ways.

A just father of fairness is not promoting his child doing wrong to others, that here is a wise father, and the beauty of his daughters is in Heaven.

They do not understand justice and do not care if the person is guilty, and so a wicked person gathers more to partner with them and be destroyed with them, but the righteous has the Lord.

Let not the wicked say, “I am exceedingly great by wickedness.” Their foolishness is as pointless as nothing, but the words towards God were heard by Abel.

Being over the kingdom, you will be like the elder, and a jelous older brother is not king of a people, when he does such towards them, but justice and truth is for the mouth of a king in judgement.

There is no separation between the king and the people where the king's servant might be, and the king's servant is not their king, but a fool worthy of death is not better than a child.

Not even the king can change the truth that is God's about the fashion, ways, and order of any people, but a righteous king is difficult for the angels to speak of before God.

The Earth is cursed to sorrow, and the heart of a man has sorrow, and Beelzebub is against the good of mankind and their portion, because Heaven might commune on Earth, that the woman with many virtues is a light of beauty, and a strong man who is crafty is considered an enigma, when he is of great ability, with righteousness, and a wise child to procure favour, a noble son, to be a prince, a wise man to go further in understanding, and a righteous man to attain a great legacy in truth, by God, that if the innoccent should disappear than the Earth would decend to hell, that the wicked and the evil are benifiting from the prescence of the good and righteous, and exploiting the world that is upheld by their precence, by the hand of God. So they have despised when what they would attain is possible by the good and righteous. There is the person who hates themselves because of their actions, and hating themselves more, they will not depart from doing wrong, and there is the person who is meant to be punished and the punishment does not come, and so they retaliate that they might perish, when the wicked are for them, and there are less righteous upon the Earth.
	Why then are you contending with those who are not of the world, whether Heaven, or the world, but are attempting to debate and offer their own world as their attempt, when you are for excelling more, and they are not an offence to you? But render to Ceaser what belongs to him, and to God what is God's, that you not provoke yourself to be the device of the anti-Christ. The one who looks to where they are going does not stumble and crash into calamity, and from the hand of the abundant comes gifts to others. But spiritual beings are you then, and always will be, not being able to be otherwise, and of great worth, every one of you, and the Lord's inheritence, that he wishes you not to abuse yourselves, and if such abuse should come from the wickedness of another they will be guilty in the measure that the Lord judges them. Now how is that the one who exceeds the many in the worth that is judged and measured by God is judged by the wicked and foolish to be doing wrong in decerning such a truth when the decernment is from God, because they have done exceedingly well? But Beelzebub might send Cain, and send his foolish servants, to extinguish that which is benificial, in earnest, despite envy, to what God desires. Then will the kingdom be yours, that you might inherit what was to be theirs? Indeed God is not a fool, and as you have killed even His son, so again you will raise your hand against others in your jelousy and envy, that if they have a mother, she will be less bitter, because her child was belonging to God and His kingdom, and was killed because of their great worth, and the acts of Beelzebub. So disgusting Beelzebub has committed his acts again with the use of his servants, who he will betray, and his will to kill what is benificial to God and His kingdom is never to be satisfied. But they have in them the spirit of Beelzebub, who is in the world, mingled with their envy, jelousy, and hatred, that their murder of those who are of great excellence before God might commence.

Do not stoop to an enemies level if you have God, rendering what was rendered, because as they add to their wrongs so they descend and you are then to be greater than them, and loved by God.

The one defiling is more defiled than what they do, and then they are brought to eternal pain and destruction, but the way of the wise is for life.

The task they were given made them strange and evil, carrying out what is perverse and becoming far worse than what they did, so that a pure person has stepped onto the sight of a massacre and it is so by God.

When they did not have remorse their paths became strange that they might want to do that which is not of people, but a man of guilt is better than the evil.

One has the multitude of a nation’s soldiers who are charged with the citizen, another the soldiers of criminals, and another the soldiers who do war against another country, and the one who also is supported by the love of God. Now a criminal is not to have the support of a country or the support of God, and when their heart is disloyal there destruction would be a calamity for them. But who is the fool who kills one of the tribe with more might and in power when their power is very small in comparison? But righteousness is exceedingly better when the laws are for good and acceptable that you might have your opinion and want but that you also have peace when it is well for you that a nation is for you. The might of soldiers and even those soldiers who would fight another nation is supportive of you and your righteousness that you know even those who rebel against the nation in action, and their lack of prudence. For the weapons are not held for a pointless reason and the power of righteous men is not weak or lacking understanding. But do not think you are against the king when he is for you because of your righteousness, but rather you are against his enemies that God might not separate righteousness from righteousness. But let righteousness not be deceived to evil by that wisdom that abandons morality for a good cause.

We are living in the consequences of even 1500 or even 10 c.e. and of course 1920 so that they are living in an England that is not, a Europe that is no more, an America not much altered in thinking, so that the arragance of the golden age of science is replaced by a Benjamin that is seeking after something different, cared for and yet not knowing their wars. Will this end or continue? But the evil from God might correct a person who would judge in a way that is not just. The evil spirit from God has visited the one who He might correct. Honour then your father and mother and honour God with judging in a just fashion, that you not swallow the afflicted that have been done injustice.

There is a person driven back in their evil who claims it is injustice that they have been driven back, but the fear of God is fearing His judgements.

Why does the foolish animal rage when it would not matter if they are right about something? But a man keeping with fairness and truth is with the grace of life.

A person of rage and jealousy and rage being all their substance when there is no cause, and the wrath of these being all their substance, bears the mark of death on their head, and Beelzebub has taken them already to do all his will.

Person ceases joining in on contention when their sub-conscious registers that they are possessing the same traits as is being accused. But the one who will not join in on the stoning of another is acceptable to God.

A man who becomes angry when he is jealous is an unstable ground of fire and transgression, but the one with self control is not offending.

The one acting differently because of what is not better is thrown about to be wayward, but the one who would be focused on their own life, and not coveting in jealousy, does not stray to lose what he has.

Why do the wicked join in to stone the one God favours more? But the wrath of God is with greater things than the wicked, to do revenge against them who would do such evil.

So the angel who is tenderly loved has considered your people that I am one of them here, that they cannot bear all and my goodness I know will not seek to trouble them less I hurt myself, that good is for them and they will have more when they have more fully joined the Lord who is in Heaven, when they have shed their flesh for what is for them. Now will I, not wishing to hurt myself, hurt these women who are beautiful to me or these wise who cannot bear more? But they are to be loved and I rely upon prudence and goodness.

God is not for the children of Beelzebub, that they might wield scripture so that they have already shed blood, and then to do the work of evil and wickedness against God’s house. But the children of Beelzebub have their kingdom in fire and anguish, and as they would kill the righteous they do of themselves and their master who has them.

A wicked mouth puts a gap in the spirit and this an injury but let God restore all. The one who harasses sexually puts evil in their spirit and is violent. The one who makes threats that torture is condemned to die whether physical that are upon the head or threats of death. The one who attacks for a length of time that is exceeding the possibility of a man has sought another’s blood. The one who condemns the victim in a fashion to crush them is deserving of death, and they have no place in Heaven. That by all fashions of safety they have done violence and torture and sought to mutilate. All these things they are doing and what will they be known to be? But when they call out to Christ with good hope they will be condemned to hell where there is pain and anguish forever, to death. Better is the one who molested the child who sunk to the depths of the ocean. And all these things him and his allies did.

Concerning what has been said in a day prior, or 2000 years, I do not know if much was added to His word in the letters of disciples, or if any of it was from His word, only there are wise words and then many paragraphs of small matters and certainly ancient people knew about how to sow discord in an enemy nation before war. The discord was likely meant to cause chaos and weaken the nation, and if for some reason the Christians and Jews joining forces was to be viewed as a possible threat the attempts at dealing with pety matters with horrendously devisive wording might make sense if an attempt was made to break a single book of Christian wisdom into many parts so that paragraphs of lesser matters might be added for other purposes. Certainly a fearful Roman intelligence force could plant such documents and possibly after the death of all the original disciples. Of course this might cause an embarrassed dismay among non-Jewish Christians to view such a failure by non-Jews early on, but perhaps this is the reality we might have to admit, a failure and yet possibly true. Certainly we can admit that the apostles words are worded so that they might be seen as devisive and it is my belief that much was added that would not be deemed worthy of a Bible’s attention due to how trivial some of the matters seem to be. As for the other books, I have no comment on them, and my scrutiny was only towards much that is found in the letters. Now as for discord it is sowed for the purpose of strength or weakness. I will not write an obvious lie to be used as propaganda when it has been dealt with by others. But where attempts to sow discord become hostile our known fools who have not bettered themselves are now attempting to impair their own people and this sometimes with attempts that harass and cause grief that their own people should be impaired. Now sub-concoius envy seeks to impair others when a person is impaired, that envy seeks equality, being that offensive action can transform jealousy to envy and by outward attempts transformations are made. So the accuser is to be doing the will of what is not considered better, and yet there are many who accuse who do so in the way of light, which belongs to God that there is good truth that is motivated by truth. Now if all of those who open their mouths against the realm of Beelzebub accuse than the accuser of truth is not motivated by the lesser things, but the better things in the realm of God. What waters will be watered and a generous soul will be made fat, that the one who is restored, being a Jew or not, who was greatly generous is not to be considered because of the will of the one who deceived and seeks evil. Now if none had said it or written it than the angel would not have, only, I believe, to offer his wisdom in a better way because the gate is to be left open by the one who does not perceive the threat of war. Now do not allow the children, being adults, who are in Beelzebub’s house accuse the disciple or any of doing wrong in this matter because God’s will is for them to do good, that you do not add some judgement that is not from God or men, but a matter of personal choice, and the same is for stating my consideration for the Jews, where they might be, knowing that God knows which are His in this fashion. But let not God’s inheritance attack Him when we are united, because the Pharases were not of Abraham and those who would kill His son not found in honour of God. But Jews are born of and raised by non-Jews and more are with remnant of Israel and the anti-Christ is severely hating all who are worshiping God.

The person who does not value another who is human is of no value, but the substance of worth is found with the righteous.

There is a servant who hates the righteous and another the wise, but the son who does good is not forgotten by God.

The command is evil and the servant did all, but a righteous man who is great is being kept in prisons.

Better to be delivered by righteousness than by the sword, but the one who commits no wrong is for placing his foot upon the neck of a wicked accuser.

The one who would save themselves by wickedness is dieing by it, but the one saving themselves by righteousness is living forever.

A lion who deserves to die is not better than a dog who is in the way of life, but wisdom is with morality.

There is a time and place for all, but those lacking knowledge do not know it, but a wise child is better than a foolish king, and foolish person who is a child is grievous.

All things, all labels of people, are also for the mentally impaired, that impaired is not the right word, since we know as people what is acceptable, but a general label used in a reckless fashion is not fitting for conversations of peaceful accuracy.

A wise woman who is claimed to lack something in terms of her mind’s ability is like a jewel of wisdom upon the plains, but a woman wicked and reckless is wayward and grievous.

An empty fool will not open his mouth much, but the one who shuts their lips is wise.

There is the gracious who is beloved, when they are truly good, but the one who feigns meekness and is a ravenous wolf is a servant among those who would eat the scraps of the child.

The self-loathing sicophant is homicidal, but the one who promotes good is considered wise.

I am for being patient to the extremely sensitive who lash out, because they are not well, and such is probably temporary. For a species is not against itself and the understanding of a man is like the Christ.

If one should wish to be in the realm of childhood, which is good and pleasing to God, than they should be innocent, but the one who enters into offensive action must know the understanding and morality of a wise adult.

Even an old woman is killed by a soldier when they pick up a weapon in battle, though they were a civilian, and so the one who would be innocent and prudent, will not be required to pay the price and consequence. But even a woman, when she enters into those crimes, must have the wisdom of an adult man, and his morality, that consistency is wisdom, and when such is committed the judgement is understood. But do not think a woman keeping to that which is of civilians and women are deserving of death, or any civilian, when they are not doing that which is truly an offense for them, because the citizen and civilian has their commands, that they follow.

A prudent person will do nothing when they do not know, but fools will die, and do not want knowledge.

What am I to say of them? If the women was done right to in what the wise of them have desired, than there would be a lessening of the sin and foolishness of many of the men who are brutal fools towards men and women. So I wondered about a test between them but such was foolishness. So the wise daughters are good and have made their plea that the generation that fought their war now fights to defile them with a perverse harassment, saying we fought for you and you will not do what we say to be servants to us. But the sibling was not made by God to be a servant but is belonging to God, and is also His child.

So I was angered, and said, “They’re developing pedophile. You're supposed to say no. Do not make it so the woman cannot be a woman for her benefit and God’s.”

The wicked has forbidden the righteous of doing what is right by the girl when he has behaved honourably that the girl has the right, being robbed, to reap revenge upon the wicked.

It is expected that the guilty will first accuse the righteous of their wrongs, so that by understanding we know when it is so with ease and no disruption and peace in what is expected because of the understanding of a man.

A robbed woman is lashing out at a man, but greatness he has, and honour to his credit, for the man who finds a wife gains favour from the Lord.

Now her good is beautiful and she will have what she desires, for a foolish woman is causing trouble, and the nobility of God is for the greater rewards, that the many rewards to the virteous woman were partially concealed from the eyes of the foolish woman, though she perceives that more is there than what is for her when she does, that the woman who has abandoned might say, “I will be for what is good and better”, that she might cause herself to be new, and so making due repentance by right to those she offended and finding what is to be hers as she goes her way. Now not often does any find this grace because of stubbornness and the preservation of the wicked, and yet with some the grip is undone by them, and yet still there is justice offered, but the hearts have forgiven when God judged it put away, that there is no grief or sense of injustice if it is the truth from God.

An inconsistent woman in all, she is more foolish than the foolish woman, contradicting herself in everything and not knowing it because she does not have the wisdom of the daughters, and relying even in her attempts upon that which is not correct for what she claims, and she is claiming to be entitled to a husband because she exists, and that men do not do what they should, but she does not perceive and understand, and so she is left like a desolate one whose land was destroyed, and yet the grace of God is exceedingly great, and she is in His keeping, when she has been with righteousness and did not understand all that here you will know that where there is a break the will of God is upon the land, and so I am in the city, and let the wise know that the Lord desires truth, for the enemies of the righteous will receive their punishment, and those with integrity will be held blameless. For God is loving that He might not fail.

A man who becomes angry when he is jealous is an unstable ground of fire and transgression, but the one with self control is not offending.

The doer accusses the righteous, or does so in mocking, that they might be a spectacle of wickedness and foolishness, but the consequence is at hand with truth, and the justice from God is in truth.

An older woman has attempted to make herself as is right to her and him, because she loves him, and the young man is for her, but daughter of the nation, there is another way, that you might not take a thing too far, but more likely attain what you desire, that in your good intentions you not do foolishness.

Lesser to more through offence conversion or translation, is the way of compensation for an evil translated to another thing within a person. For an offender acts outwardly against and the new state is more outwardly against others which is required for translation, that what was more inwardly kept is now more outwardly done and in another form.

Jealousy translated into envy by offensive action is more tolerable for some people who have niche neurosis, being sensitive more, in a fashion, but a man with love is much by any standard.

Offence is threat to something, either sub-conscious or conscious. Reactions to perceived threats might lend clues as to the inward state of a person. Insecurities increase the likelihood that something will be perceived as a threat. Insecurities can be based on substance, nurtered, or based on misconception and thus fictional.



If jelously translates or	converts to envy by offensive action, than a person might have an example of how external, extroverted state might contain the translations of products that were less offensive in another state. Imagine then there is a prosecutor who has all different traits than others and those traits are directed towards others, so that the traits of others are entirely different, and none of those traits are found in him, and the prosecutor is deemed to be better by some, and worse by others, and imagine that there is found him substances that emerge from being a prosecutor that have no comparison for translation, so that he has generated new traits that are entirely from himself, and his substance. Now if envy does not give an upright honour to others, and seeks to equalize at times what is more and better than it, seeking equality, and the envious person is seen to be lesser than many, how will the envious being considered a member of the same society as those who do not possess much envy, and are in fact better and of a different type of people, psychologically, and what psychological groups of people, in this different personality type and personality family system, or nation system, are compatible with each other, which are not, so that society might be capable of functioning without the false appearance of anti-social personalities when they only are not compatible with a people group, being of a different psychological nation that is not considered to be compatible. Now this would entail separating people from every nation, to re-locating them to the countries where they are best suited, so that the re-locations would happen at a young age, entire schools being dispersed and different students going to different countries where they are to be with their psychological nation group. Could much be more terrifying and impermissible, morally? Perhaps there are worse things in history, but not much. So the consideration is for the purpose of curiosity, and as all know the truth, anyway, and all are human, it is unlikely that any small incompatibilities are of real concern for many reasons that are understood with science, and how people adapt immediately, by truth.
	Now those who are willing to voluntarily depart to a greater extent to be amongst those they are compatible with, being those who have the understanding that is hidden from the eyes of others, that they might seek to join a society that is more preferable to them, shunning the hazards and problems of the society they are in, where they can be among society that is living at a greater degree of its potential, because this pleases them and their heart is for it, than why have they only shown the bad examples of such things, where chaos unfolded, and disaster occured, and not the many more times such has been carried out with peace and the free departure of those who are part of such societies, who wished to indulge in that which would give them the peace to be among those they wished to be with, and departing from that which was not worthy of them and what they could be, and what humanity might deserve, when it is willing, that the enclosures are free for them to depart, and they do regularily, if they so desire, and the way in is selective that some are cast out who wish to only sow problems because their heart is not for what they have joined, so that some have wished to do what is advantageous, that if society is able to hold a country stable than there can be a city within where the chosen are to be for their own benifit and by their own will, doing good and pursueing what is better. How then is such shown to be evil when it is portrayed, and many have joined such groups prior and departed from them and the media had no interest in them when they spoke well of what they had been part of, understanding that such a concept is shunned by North America, in the media, and among some who are controlling much of how anything is portrayed, when the groups of this kind are not all evil, not all being hostile and evil to those who are still members of the country in which they reside, with the same laws, that cannot be changed, and the police able to investigate when wrong is occurring, that their leaders do not do base things like take their wives, and ask them to commit suicide, but they have been shown by a bias hand to always be what they are most often not.
	Perhaps there is something to be said about this 'strong hand' that I call the media and its control what we are shown and what we are told to believe about specific groups and different ideas, so that the 'strong hand' that is the media and sometimes politicians, has given us false opinions at times that many seem unable to break with due to the lack of information available. The concept of cyber-bullying even, is talked about often in the media and the word 'cyber-bullying' is used frequently and discussed on shows and the news, and yet with the ability to block any person on the internet, to speak to whom you please, and to simply turn off the computer if so desired, the concept of cyber-bullying is not exactly real in most cases, and by reality and definition, cannot be real in most cases. However, if an older person is asked about such a topic, they would most likely show great sympathy for the idea and those who have been 'cyber-bullied' because they are good and have sympathy and what they have been told, is not all of the vital truth about such a concept. Some have become alienated from society by knowledge, having witnessed the large amounts of false information and deception in society, and been pushed away from society, with a great sense of iscolation that they did not deserve, if not for the 'cyber-bullying' if I might make a comparison, of the news media as it targets citizens who might be watching, offering them the daily amounts of foolishness and sense of lacking common sense, that helps to alienate people and cause confusion and problems in society as people attempt to adapt to what they have witnessed on television. The wars of politicians, during a campaign, often do not consider the civilians, being citizens, who are caught in the cross-fire, and negatively effected by the low attempts and feigned lack of understanding that the media and politicians use when engaged in political warfare with each other.
	Of course the adult is favoured in court in North America, and there is an unstated degree of anarchy in which the person who behaves like a child has much bias against them from the judge or jury, so that even when they are right, they might have a hard time acheiving the help of justice, even from the police, at times, and I do not condone this, but it is an unspoken truth of our society, that the one who would be respected, to have attainment of the power of the system must behave like an adult, in a mature, and moral fashion, not degrading themselves with childish and evil words. But the case of the media does not seem to respect either idea, being a bias for the one behaving like a child or the one behaving like and adult, because the 'strong hand' is in actuality powerful and able to edit, refuse media, pull things from the air before they are viewed, even pick and choose video clips that will be more supportive of their goals, so that I and many others rely upon the media, and yet are not able to attain the media I want, and it is likely so for others, knowing that if they do not slander you during your life, but if they disapprove, they will slander you after you are departed from this world, and those who would speak for you will not be shown in the media, so that people might even be planted at times, and a politician might agree, and this is the battle ground of politics, that is ruthless and ammoral in its viscious attacks on the reputations and liveliehoods of others, and the citizen, the viewer, is effected by the cross-fire and the low attacks and false uses of concepts that are actually different while carrying out political attacks and attacks motivated often for political reasons.
	The one who hates something in the media, might often wish to push everything that is hated to the extreme, in order to make it look rediculous, being a fairly standard tactic of defaming the person you do not agree with, and the media is capable of controlling what happens to the degree that they pick those who would push something to an unreasonable, and even wrong extreme so that the message becomes lost entirely, and the public is blasted by chaos.
	The idea that sentiments from groups like neo-nazis, INCEL, Communist, Fascist, Far-Right Groups, Far-Left Groups, can be used in movements that are seemingly carried out for different reasons that what is claimed, is not something a person would likely disagree with when they consider the level of education into tactics used for propoganda that are designed to sow discord and defame people, or push people into a realm of different opinions on a seemingly unrelated topic, the type of sub-concious warfare, almost whereby a psychologist might be able to determine with probability statistics, how a person's thinking might gravitate towards another topic, if they are an adult, and how their opinion might change on that other topic. Of course the psychology of children is often different, perhaps more reliable in some things, at least where their compassion can be concerned, but as for adults, who are considered to have a great deal of political opinions, having been reading the newspaper online, or in print, and having been ensconced in different concepts, calculations might be made, and the likelyhood of a greatly altered or slightly altered opinion on another topic might be considered high enough, that a legal movement might be used in which not many will be required to participate in delivering a corrupted and wrong message on a topic, due to the great amount of control among the few. 
	To believe that people are not crafty enough to do this, seems to be, and I apologize, naive, to what people of intelligence, with a wealth of education into strategies and standard tactics, are able to achieve, even in their manipulation of the media, and as much so in the realm of marketing. We might get a false impression from witnessing the desperate and incompetent struggles of campaign strategists during elections, and believe that well educated people are still at a foolish loss for how to manipulate the public, only to understand that such strategies are not able to be well executed during a political campaign, due to the quickly changing nature of the political race, and so a false impression might be achieved with regards to the real, much greater capabilities of people who specialize in tactics and strategy, an old and well researched flied, with many highly intelligent people working long hours, producing new ideas.
	A person might consider the efforts of people attempting to create more stigma by fighting stigma, and the person who is creating more bigotry by fighting bigotry, that because of the unreasonable contention or method of fighting for something, the vast majority have a lesser opinion of the cause, and this is already understood by those who are capable of producing propoganda. Women being portrayed as irrational and combative, black people as un-supportive of justice and not supportive of law-abiding, and Jews as intolerant of non-offensive speech and literature and often rude in some manner and unconcerned for others who are not Jews, and a person can begin to imagine the way the 'strong hand' chooses to portray people, not wanting to upset people's preconceived opinions sometimes, and at many times, running over and trampling a person's sense of reason to posit lack of reason and the opinions of a few who have an agenda. When have mentally ill people really been misunderstood and hated by the police, who understand compassion, most of them, and do not actually believe mentally ill people, most of them, to be dangerous, but sometimes incur mental health issues as well due to the high stress of dealing with a high degree of contention, sometimes physical, every day, in way that seems impossible for a human who is made of flesh and bone. Of course the police are not anyone's friend and are capable of dealing with great violence, for they are not armed in a pointless fashion, and they are selected because they are strong enough for the job, and of course one does not ask the opinion of someone who is not able to speak or be silent freely, in practicality, especially when they are on duty, but that the police are not without the same level of compassion and humanity as others, seems impossible, for a coward is cruel and pety, and the police deal with much contention and perform their duty bravely. As for the problems, they are delt with between those who first pass the measure of the fullfillment of honour and concern for morality, who are proven to understand the reality and practicality of what the police must do and how they must operate, in practicality, and not by theory. The police are not ignorant to the concept of criminal harassment, as they are the primary recipients of such criminal harassment, being overly criticized, survellied, questioned in an unreasonable fashion, physically attacked, attacked with offensive words, undefended, taken for granted, blamed when other officials are to be blamed, and enduring more rigorous trouble than soldiers, in some cases, due to the utter disregard for them that they must endure as part of their performance of an almost impossible job, and so it might then be understood why a police officer does not easily regard rebuke of a citizen who is not a police officer, and why they are a stubborn group in some matters, who do not respect the criticism of any person easily, for the only people who truly seem to look out for them is other police officers, and the public takes all of what they must pass through for granted. Now do criminals want you to fight for them, when they would betray you, or have you been seperated from the experience that would give knowledge? In my country black people are supportive of the police and justice, but criminals are not, and attempts to use the worst examples to sow discord between black people and the police, is comparible to black people who have not been around white people much, and believe that they must be less accepting and more racist than many of them are, which is another, less direct method, of sowing discord between white people and black people, by not targeting white people, but putting the burden on black people. If black people are to establish their own empire, that will be mostly theirs, gaining a greatness that is comparible to ancient times somewhere on the planet, than it is understandable that North America is not a place for segregation, unless it is a private community of some type, so that in North America, that is multi-cultural and not respecting or disallowing religion, is no place for real segregation to occur, since we must continue to work together, and often do, when there is no interference. So attempts to sow discord have brought many of us together, and continue to, because we are all disgusted at the despicable things that are done, that do not show honour and respect of others and their free will and right to live their lives as they can and wish. Imagine a theoretical group that's only goal is segregation, which has members from every ethnicity, who each believe their people would be better and more benifited by segregation, and they seek to acheive this through dishonourable tactics. How are we supposed to practise such segregation when in North America we must be at the same places, and work at the same places? Is there not an added stress and burden that wears and gnaws at the sub-concious as any attempt to fullfill this concept? But it is almost like a criminal harassment of some type, and we do not need to endure more burdens in a society which has already over-burdened every citizen with its high demands on citizens to meet requirements. Even if we agreed, we are too over-burdened and do not have the energy or the sufficient ability to fullfill what you want. But a strong man has come home from a labourous task, and he has fought with many who were violent on the way, and he has delt with a crises on that very day in which people were injured and weapons were used, and coming home, scratched and bruised, and almost unable to stand, you demand now that he build a room and lay bricks, when he cannot withstand more, physically. But overly stressed to a degree that we can no longer live our lives, we do not speak of the over-burdened citizen, whether it is the high-school student, or the even more burdened adult, and must we add to that the responsibility of practising segregation when we must be at the same places as others? But some do not want segregation and even wish to marry who they please, being for something other than the concern of the tradition of their parents, for white people in North America do not really care what their parents want, even if we ritualize a concept we are not concerned with.
	The truth about an eternal humanity, immortal and governed by truth and if there is more, always apart of spirituality, whether atheistic or not, brings about the world as seen to be in the contentions of eternity, and the grande struggle between what is good and what is evil, what is wise and benificial to us, and what is imprudent and terrible for us, to understand the excellence of wisdom and the concept of truth being benificial for the stategy towards all things in the future for us, in our decisions and understanding, that we are able to attain greater amounts of wisdom, and be a sacred people who are not without great favouritism and reward. Also we are able to be at peace with others when we support what is right and defending us, and we are not attempting to be in foolish contention with others, or offending others in what we know is not honourable to others. The little things add up, until contention is great and actions begin to emerge from the contention, to be supported by arguements that have their real root in the contention that culminated in the chaos of violence and the addition of new ideology and resentment of matters, that could have been considered by others, even enemies, in a more peaceful manner if not for the little things adding up, the works of those who do small evils, who are contentious in a dishonourable fashion, so that if this even culminates in wars for the nations, than it cannot be claimed to be the behaviour of exceeding understanding and as such, we are forgiving what is to be forgiven, and defending ourselves, but know that no other person is there to receive evil without a line to be crossed in which you might reap evil, and even judgement, that you not be like a reckless fool, but are for knowing what is acceptable, that all are different, and behave differently, but that some things can only be labelled as foolish, and this should not be added to the mouth of the foolish in their folly, but only that it should not be spoken of, unless it is to say what is common sense, that different people are different and yet right and wrong is still the same, and a person does not judge by a measure that is not for humans, because the person who judges by such a measure is lesser, and not greater, than the one whose heart has been enlarged, and in doing so they know their injustice, for a greater one is among you who will be defended by fire and the power of clean spirits, who is sacred and is more than you, and I have perceived some of these, that they are still not as much as angels, but they are like something to yield to in the manner in which is respectful and with the fear of God. So I will say, Forbid not with adding morality to the limit of morality, that you not be considered an evil fool, and commit injustice, but the hand of a righteous man does not steal in wrath. If you would do well, then even I do not know all of what your reward will be, and if you will be honest, what measure of righteousness is there. But there is one who moralizes and is destroyed, and yet is it much fault that it should be mentioned, when the moralizing came because the injustice was not articulated properly, that the true wrong was there, and moralizing was only an attempt to articulate what had occurred? But when the words are not an offence, when the moralizing is not truly moralizing, who then will be found with guilt, and who is truly moralizing in being angry? But those who harrass with what is beyond the limit of morality, and yet using what would be morality, are of the prosecutor, Beelzebub and are his device in the matter, when it is against the one who is preferable to them, and those who go beyond the measure of a civilian, into the realm of soldiers, to do that for which they have no heart, but use wrong things, knowingly, as weapons, in a fashion like a soldier and not a citizen who is in contention, is motivated by something even greater in themselves, being a large motive, whether good or evil, and the later being the more likely case, for who is it that wages war with other citizens when they are not soldiers, and if it is so, it must be some great, evil motive, that is hidden inside them. But a soldier is not greater than a civilian when the soldier goes to war with them who are civilians, but much less than the civilian, that a madman and fool is waging violence and mayhem, and has made himself as if great, in his specticle of violence and mayhem, whereby he wages all types of evil and wickedness, attacking those who are civilians, setting fire to himself, and being a vessel of much sin as he causes much trouble. So he is brother to the one who attacks with slander, being a sinful fool, who is as a madman  firing arrows and throwing stones, to kill, and a perverse fool the same when he claims, in hostility of warfare, that he is the person's friend, that he attempts to do no evil, being of some great and clear hostility and anger, that he might not break character, even after many rebukes, not hardening his neck like an evil fool who attacks with offensive, passive-aggression and hostility, but as one who is so hostile and angry that he does not break character, for he is for attacking with much aggression, and he has become a charging bull, with horns, and a sinful device of transgression, that he has perverted the ways of judgement and justice in the anger and aggression of his attack, and with his hostility, he speaks more aggression and offence, to claim he is a friend, and he should be slain with a sword when it is because of jelousy, or any small matter, where great anger is not considered to be human, and such is the case with one of these. So the servants of the one he is attacking harden their necks to be deaf to what is heard, and harden their hearts to be blind to comprehension of what is an evil attack and lies, that they are given to the anti-Christ, to be servants to the one who is attacked in this way, but those with Christ are opening their ears and their eyes to the truth, and in earnest listening and knowing what is right, that their deeds might perform what is good, according to God, who is in Heaven, the Lord of both the person attacked and the one who would exercise good for God, to be with the angels in such matters, and mostly with God, that they are pleasing to Him, even if the hearts of many in official places is against them, even in their words, to put them astray with councilling that seems good, but is the work of the anti-Christ, that you might not abandon the good that you do by their councilling, that if the anti-Christ attacks, so the children of God will unite and fight in a good and noble fashion, obeying the law of the land, that is acceptable to God, those who are able, and those it has been given to, that the hyena might not swallow the cub who is a lion, that God will prevail, and the work of the anti-Christ be put down with the works that are of pure and blameless innocence before God. So the one who is not yours will be defended, and go his way, or taken into your company, if you require to give him encouragement. And the blessing that is for the one you saved, will be added to you, and to the blessing that you were to be given, and have, that their works, some of them, when they have been good, that have a reward, are rewarded to them you saved, and rewarded to you, much or some, that reward will be added to your reward. So you have dwelt with angels and pleased God, that you have not ceased in your attempts to defend for God, and have gathered more of those who are God's, that the anti-Christ might not gain ground, and be moved far back from your border for a time, which is done in the spiritual fashion.

Because you are with them who are not compatible with your nation, and you are with tasks you are not suited for but they are acceptable, and so the land has become as it was in Isaiah, but let them be righteous and they will be with your nation, that the true remnant might become greater in number. Now will God not restore when you are doing what is good to your neighbour? But God  has even forgiven murderers and thieves and you who are pleasing God are deemed of great value. But as for heavy matters it is better, I think, not to dwell in land plagued by brutality and violence where prostitutes are abused and every manner of wicked brutality, but as is known, the Romans whipped Him and crucified Him and He was beaten and robbed of garments and yet God, His father, restored Him on the third day, and He remained on Earth until His time had come to ascend to Heaven, to be greater there, and pure. Now if an angel has been on Earth in mortal form and endured persecution, know that it for some purpose of the Lord that such is permitted. But as for, children of God, do you not know you have all that was for the Christ from God because He paid the work for you. But know then that Beelzebub has infested and seized his children for his will and they are committed, but Beelzebub has deceived them to betray them to what is not benificial for them. But God is all powerful and to trust him is reasonable, even for the angel who has chosen what is better for them.

The enticement would take a person away from wisdom and it’s many rewards, to be cast out and to endure grief at much loss, but the future is with the Lord and His power is absolute.

The one who lacks much knowledge and says in their heart that they know, and is inventing lies within themselves to be as truth to them, that they might say in their hearts they know, is arrant to such an extent that they are reviling what is a higher life-form to them, like something below the person's animal, who is cared for, and a little below their servant, if they would have one, if the servant was a fool. That rather than giving worship, they revile, and their hatred is for what is holy over their place, that they are not holy, but base flesh and nothing beyond. And so it is if they meddle when they are not welcome to meddle, into matters where they encroach when they are not indulging in the good of friends, or the duty of citizens among themselves, or the actions in which such is nothing to mention, but there is required no teacher for such things, or no speaker of wisdom, or no judge who is wise, for why should any content in a foolish fashion when more is not mentioned and explained by the one who dispenses wisdom with consideration? But because of that foolishness there is given more, because of consideration of what fools might perform, and a man and woman does not require it and it is not always given by others, or even by me, that they know what is right. But where there is experience in the matter, a person will know. That where it is so, then it will be understood to be so by the one who understands, and where it is not so, why does anyone accusse with foolishness? Is it because of what does not have to be said? But all is such, and even from myself, that no expectation is in prudence that a person cannot comprehend another when more is not said, and not with exageration. But God has given people the ability to comprehend, and will the anti-Christ seek to exploit what they are unwilling to know and keep firmly? But what is within a person is their own business, and a person exercising self-control is not offending, and cannot be judged by any person. Now actions are judged and what is said to others might be judged, but what is within a person may only be judged by God, and not any person. But fools have behaved like wicked children, who cannot even come from women, but as if infested by a wicked foolishness that marks a person upon the head, as being that which is a calamity within themselves, and so it might be understood, but not for judgement, but the action is judged and the truth about them is known, that lack of comprehension beneath humans might not be used in the same fashion by which they accuse in foolish error. Now a person is explained, but where is the judgement? But if a person comes upon one who is minding their own business, who is not in contention presently with a person, but is an enemy in a fashion that has been occuring, and an enemy is coming upon them to slay them with guile, then the injury to themselves is as a great destruction, that the bone is snapped and the person split in two, that their life might flow out of them, that so it was written should be done to them on Earth, that Heaven and Earth might be in obediance to God's judgement. Now what is done in a spirit of defence, presently, even in the small measure, is not as the one mentioned by Moses, but offers defence that the offender might not advance upon the one who is innocent so that they should not be advanced upon. Now if a person would speak in such a way within themselves, it is for God to know, and not another, that none can judge what is not an action. Now if a person is advancing upon another spiritually than does not the one who fights draw the sword to defend themselves? But it is not the case that any will be done enduring harm when the one who defends does not commit any error, because they were truly defending themselves. Now those who are not fools know what is acceptable, and yet you would use the laws and commands like those who cannot understand? Hypocrites, and prosecutors, and those who would feign much in yourselves. But why do you say there is judgement where there are words? Such understanding is not real, and cannot be with any person.
	Now will your substance be sin or what is precious to God, for you will reap what you sow, says the son of God, that you not reap sin by committing it, that what you are doing to others is recompensed as good to you, that as you judge and by what measure, so will be the measure by which you are judged, that the Pharases could not withstand, if they had judged, that their many attempts to defame are seen as misheiouv to me, and the consideration of foolishness, that truth is not pursued with God, but they are devising what is pervesity in the fashion in which they sin, to be a perverse people, able to bear in their spirit what is like a great bone out of joint, and a twist and grotesqueness, that they are not with goodness. Now by what measure they transgress is as those who would rise up to fight with violence at Abraham, to rise up with war-like advancementst towards Jacob, that their will for another, being in servatude to Beelzebub, unable to do what is right, because they are bound to their master and they cannot become the children of another, unless they are to transform, for to become the children of God, that is, to begin to do his will in a matter, is beyond them, and they are incapable, that such would be like that fear of death for them, and more powerful than the avoidance of death for a very selfish man, who does not have love or bravery. They have turned their backs on Solomon, and they have grimmaced and stood against David, in much hatred, that Enoch is above them, to speak of them, and they condemn their father, Adam, the first, who walked with God in the garden. How will any call these Jews, because they are alienated from the heart of Moses, and Isaac they have had hostility towards, that violence is with them and transgression, that they are intelligent, but fools, and I will not even go so far to write anything about God in this matter, for the angel who judges them has also judged their father, that the works of them are seen as an enemy to what is God's.
	
Those who seem to add those ideas to society that are grievances to many, might realize that their real problem is with sociopaths and even people with anti-social personality disorder, so that foolishness might be spoken of and understood, but the likelyhood of wisdom being of benifit to a sociopath seems unlikely, as they prefer those proverbs and ideas that suit them, and not that which is shunned by what they are. Of course maxums for waging physical war do not find much strategic application, truthfully, in society, in which wisdom would not have been the better strategy, even for crime, although it is more likely that those who gravitate to such ideas are in search of something different, and are not the type who might believe in the strategy that might trust God, or the truth of the Universe, and human psychology and limitations, that might be another way of expressing the same concept for those who do not believe in any deity. If a fool has said in his heart that there is no right and wrong, and if he does not regard right and wrong, or fear right and wrong, than perhaps a person might only rely upon hope for development, that fullfilling needs not met, and increasing a person's true self-esteem, can be benificial for development in many ways. Are the fatherless the sociopaths of the Old Testiment? I would think not, but the message does not seem to be easily compared to modern psychology and to posit psychology, another paradigm from the Old Testiment, in direct congruence with the Old Testiment, would be a fallicy. But proverbs identifies many different types of fools and different types of men and women, even the kings who go on the ground, instead of on horse-back, being poor and kings, much in the way the Christ was a king. The book of Ester seems to list different types of non-Jews, like the servant of a non-Jewish society, who was enemy to the Jews and hated them, probably, in my opinion, considering them bullies in a slanderous fashion, if my understanding of such a person is correct, and being given to crying in anger and wrath when presented with even the slightest defeat in his contentions against a person who is preferable to him. The sociopath, or psychopath, not to be confused with the mental health disorder, known as 'anti-social personality disorder' has consistently been ignored by the news media, who present sociopaths as being something other than what they are. Psychologically retarded individuals who lack the ability to understand others at the same level as a small child, and lacking many of the defence mechanisms that average people possess, they are often not the type to greatly want attention from others, but whose focus can sometimes be upon others in ways that lacks self-control, or 'impulse control' and the proper defence mechanisms, being internal defences, that might used to properly deal with, resist, and work through the difficult problems of life that can be difficult even for a child with average abilities to deal with. Sometimes violent, other times not prone to violence, they can still be unpredictable due to their lack of psychological ability to properly deal with what they feel and must deal with, and add to that a lack of impulse control, that can be varied, and it might be understood why some insist that society should understand how dangerous they can be. Why even sociopaths, or other abject types, who are anti-social elements of society should gravitate towards concepts like 'white sepremacy' or neo-nazi gangs that they can not gain membership with, I assume, seems to be based upon the concept of Hitler's mission and beliefs during world war II as they are portrayed as destructive attempts by people excerting their 'id' on society towards the weak and impaired and groups they found to be an 'other' in their society, the Nazi image, being for many, the embodiement of wrath and anger towards that which must be trampled, and transfered to many in society, who might manifest their anger in Nazi terms with a regard for genocide, against groups they seem to detest, often groups supported by liberals, with the belief that white sepremacy is the same as being a more extreme conservative, who hates all that is left-wing, and not the belief in the superiority of the white race whether left or right wing, and its preservation of a white culture and heritage. If the wrath of the human id has chosen Hitler, than it is sometimes those who would be the greatest problems for society who seem to have mistakenly associated themselves with his message, not realizing that they were likely to be targets of his genocide attempts, and those they detest might have been accepted among the Nazis, as being, by their standard, a benificial member of society.
	As for the opposition to the morality of the Old Testiment, it is not anything that I know of, only opposition to religious practises based on a person's personal opinions, and as much as Judeasm has influenced our culture prior in history, aspects of it being assimilated by Europeans over a thousand years prior, and presently being part of our culture and heritage in a way that cannot be removed, much like concepts from the New Testiment, there is probably more often the belief that it is 'our religion now' as has been claimed by some in the Christian religion, when seeking to justify the existence of the religion as prevaliant and assimilated by Europeans and passed on to North Americans with immigration. Freedom to explore and free speech is not attacked by such a concept among those who believe in the idea of preserving a white culture that permits white people to create and learn in the way they always have, exploring ideas, studying, and expressing opinions as those whose culture is secure and preserved from any forceful and negatively encroaching influence of other cultures when such is not in keeping with what is brought forth and part of white culture, what it was, and where it might go, so that the destiny, in this ideology, is to be white, at least for white people, and black for black people, although what  other ethnicity do is of no concern, presumably, to those who wish to preserve a white culture and heritage. As a person, myself, who does not believe in segregation, but is white, and is open to many ideas that some might consider to be beyond the realm of normal and average, I have still remained prejeduce against the existence of neo-nazis and white sepremecy, and have little knowledge beyond what is stated about what they do in North America, how loyal they are to the cause of white sepremecy in favour of personal problems or struggles for control, how well they keep their people in line to avoid allowing members to commit crimes that's action is a denigration of oneself, and whether they are always, in fact, doing what their mission claims, in general, which is attempting to preserve, rather than acts of violence, harassment, or any act that would differentiate them from a political group that operates more publicly in society. Do they choose to be secretive, or are they not given publicity? Much mystery seems to be part of the public sense of paranoia towards a nefarious group of 'white supremacists' whose actions are unknown, even to white people, and are dispersed among various groups, with different organizations performing different deeds. Not being Nazis, and not being concerned for politics, so long as it remains among white people, I assume, they are of course a racist organization in the literal fashion, being primarily concerned with their own race, and the segregation of its future from any influence that might forcefully and negatively encroach. The racism being literal, seems to imply an indifference to the concept of calling names, and more a geniune focus, openly, on race and segregation, different of course from black nationalists, who would have the claim that they were brought to North America by slavery, where they have received prejiduce, but instead being in the place of defenders against what their own history might have caused to occur, being the bringing of foreign influence to white culture, and the adaptation to other people groups, sometimes even in speech, although the variation of beliefs upon the concept of common curtousy and politeness, might depend upon the individual adherent to white supremacy. As for those neo-nazi members who have carried out acts of violence, in ways that are despicable, they are of course terrorists, and called so by the Canadian government, the country in which I reside, and any disruptive influence on the part of neo-nazis in Canada, as it effects the stability of the nation, is truly like the actions of a foreign invader who seeks to weaken us, even cripple us, as we struggle to prosper and help our people for the future of our country.
	The evils committed by organizations cannot be dissociated from the people who are in them, and if a gang is committing criminal activity it is indeed a gang of criminals, and even a terrorist organization when the crimes are outside of the dealings of criminals and target people who are not involved in crime, when they are pursuing their rights and freedoms, so that Canada, and I, can only denounce them as what they are, being a gang of criminals where they have committed crimes, that we are capable of acting in a legal fashion, and choosing what we wish, to pursue our rights and freedoms without the presence of those who commit terrorism.
	If there is something that might be learned it is that there are many ways to catagorize society, but some ways are truthful and others misleading, and ultimately misguiding. To state that there are really two groups, being those who abide by the law and those who do not, does not seem to be misleading, since the struggles and wars between different groups seems to sometimes include others in the cross-fire who are merely doing all that is required and are attempting to pursue goals that are not part of any ongoing struggle or war, since society cannot all be of these type, that it might continue as some fight for positive change. Discord can be sown by groups whose mission was good but became corrupt, so that I have produced the proverb, There is one who detests and so pushes the enemy to the extreme, that they might abolish them and their goal. To understand the various movements is to often see cases where groups either 'die on the vine' from much reason and good reputation, due to a media that desires greater conflict, and those who become too radical and descredit their cause and sow negative sentiments against their own cause. The media is there for profit, and not for the facilitation of what is good and reasonable, and so as stories change and attention is shifted elsewhere, groups can only hope to deliver a good message while they have the time alloted to them, and hope that nothing emerges to discredit their cause. The fashion in which the media will feature items and then dispense of them seems to be based upon what events have occurred and who they choose to show at those times is likely to be chosen, and if a person might say things that are not wanted, the video footage might not be shown to the public, so that we can speak about the strong hand of the media and its great control over North American democracy, portraying things as they wish, and shunning that which they do not approve of, so that we can take concepts that have been invented, and begin to extrapolaite as to where the conversation might be going, and what the new precedence is that the media is attempting to establish, at a time when the strong hand is able to dig up false dirt, and portray things as they wish, so that we might begin to wonder about the blogs of public figures, and alternative sources of media to tell us that which we will not be told by the press. Why some causes are always portrayed as being too radical and unreasonable to listen to without dismissing, creates a different climate in the world than what is shown in the media, where in the media it might seem that people are becoming more and more sympathetic to something, to a degree that abandons reason, often, so that in the real world people might becoming more unwilling to take the topic seriously, dismissing it as nonsense, and talking among themselves about how foolish the world has become, and they will not conform to this nonsense, due to how unreasonable it is portrayed to be, without any voice of reason on television to give people the sense that they are not all being persecuted. Thus, the concept of propaganda, and attempts to create more unreasonable discourse on television aids the public in the concerted belief that what they see on television, and all the causes presented, cannot be taken seriously, and are unreasonable so that they should simply be dismissed.
	New attempts to curtail freedoms of speech in various areas has presented many with a sense of persecution and, although, a person cannot reason using uniformitarion beliefs, which is the belief that everything is a slippery slope, and that things will only continue to move in a direction, some have wondered if the government is attempting to create scenarios where those practising free speech can be arrested more easily, and in a fraudulent fashion, which could be another way in which politicians are seizing more power that will be for another to wield, since they will not be in office when such things come to fruition. Humanity, of course, has limits, and when something in society reaches a certain limit, human nature dictates that society will probably go in another direction, somewhere totally new, or backwards, or even a settling state on an issue. Not watching television might help people think more clearly about the world, without the fog of war, or the fog of the media, to partially blind us to what the real facts on a matter are. Of course it makes sense to read the newspaper, but if some things must be taken with a grain of salt, some things must be taken with two grains of salt, and the newspaper is capable of creating a sense of apocalypse, when the real issues are a little different.

Metaphysics has not offered me every answer I require, and I do not read it, only I have delved into the theories of my own indulgence to wonder if particles are bound and cannot be teleported due to the bond that keeps them in their place, and if such bonds can be broken, even around an object like a rock, it can be teleported to a different place, possibly if the bonds between specific particles are broken with the particles surrounding the object, being the rock in this case, so that the desire is to cause the rock to disappear from the Universe, and be pushed into the Universe in another location, by a type of exchange between this Universe, and a possible parellel Universe, that serves as a reserve for matter, and produces what exists from our reality in another location, essentially pushing an exact copy of the object back into our reality in another location. If a wave of light is collapsed when bonded to particles that are present in humans, being, possibly particles that are found in every brain storm, then the idea is to break the bonds that would hold an object to this reality, and if other particles that cannot be teleported are to be 'dropped' out of our reality, than a person might wonder what 'holds' them to this reality, and for what bond or reason that might include undetected matter, are these particles not capable of being teleported? If a rock can be cut off from what might hold all the space to be cut off in this reality including the rock, than would it be possible to transport all the space, including the rock, that would be 'dropped' out of this reality, that an exact copy might be pushed into our reality in another location. Perhaps only some particles are able to 'hold' space around it to this reality, so that if these bonds are ever broken around a space, than the isolated space might 'drop' out of this reality, which is the goal.
	Now why do some Christians adimately oppose the idea that humanity can travel to other galaxies by a 'star-gate' quantum teleportation project, or some other far distance project? Why do they oppose anything in science, if science does not really cause a problem for them? Why would religion ever attempt to hault any person from attempting to progress science. We are aware that a person does not have a brain that is functioning in early pregnancy, and we are aware that if the brain is not there in a person than they are not alive, and in such a case, not alive yet, which would mean that no life has happened yet, and so no life, by medical science, by biology, by common sense, can be extinguished, so that we can clearly understand that God would not give us the ability to know what is common sense, and then extend his word to mean more than what He said. Embroyonic stem cell use in science, is of course disgusting, and goes against most people's sense of human decency, but it cannot be killing any person, since no person exists to be killed. But we have religious people who are protesting and causing problems when a baby does not exist, in terms of brain activity, which might be the starting point of its life, when it becomes alive, until a later time in pregnancy, so that a person avoiding pregnancy and the later delivery, is only practising a form of contraception, which I believe would make it no one else's business, as is the expression, what they choose to do. Such puritanical thinking seems to replace Judeo-Christianity often, where the religion is mostly ignored in favour of puritanicalism, a cruel, anti-Christ ideology when it becomes its own religion, that persecutes Christian and Jews and every person on the planet. Of course we still must deal with jack-asses, as is the term, not to be confused with a profanity, when it is used in the correct fashion, who might attack people with dismissals of 'insanity' and 'crazy' when of course a person is not mentally ill for any belief they might have, only for malfunctions of the brain, since mental illness is a physical problem, and not a myth. Hallucinations are a physical problem that can be cured with medications, and as for any belief a person wishes to explore or even believe, it is not considered insanity, but acts of free speech and free thought as people explore in order to make progress for the species. Paranoia is a physical state, that keeps returning for unreasonable reasons as a person deals with a physical chemical imbalance in the brain that continously returns them to an unwanted, and uncomfortable paranoid state that is diagnosed by behaviour and not what a person might believe. Of course criminal harassment will create this state, and threats to a person when they have delt with violence, can sometimes produce this effect, which is why a psychiatrist needs to know the truth about events that might have transpired that might have lead to such an uncomfortable and unwanted state, that keeps returning. With regards to metaphysics, a person might understand the neccessity for permitting and encouraging free thought and free speech that can lead to a transfer of theories to variables and numbers as the theory that was understood by the theorist might be taken by Martha, cleaned, organized, and claimed for herself, that the prostitute who understood it and gave the directions might be praised by God, since know other person might ever remember them. Therefore I would encourge a new organization to attempt to track down the original theorists who found the answer before the variables and numbers were calculated, that more truth might be known about our 'strong handed' history, that has wiped away much knowledge, and written history as it wished, and it might be so with many things, for there are some who go so far, with such entitlement, as to believe that they are the orchestrators of what history will say, in the way in which they desregard the truth and claim that other people, or another person, did something that another did first. We know that Leaf Ericson, son of Eric the Red, came to North America hundreds of years prior to Christopher Columbus, and it has taken some time for some people to learn it. It can be far worse when it comes to science, where those who are lauded for finding the answer, are not always the first, even by far, to have found the answer to something great.
	Stephen Hawking did not win the Nobel Prize in physics, because he allegedly did not need it, and a person might suspect the possible jelousy and strong handing that might easily dismiss a scientist, and then consider a scientist who is not well known, who lives in a country where the government is less reliable to respect its citizens, and a person can ponder about who might have been ignored, dismissed, in favour of another who did not bake the cake, and the cake was stolen and given to another. Also I have produced the proverb, They claim that they stole, but the real theft is being attempted by them. Thus is another situation in which jelousy might cause grief in the way in which people lie, the way in which people who have not accomplished something hide the real person who they discovered the idea from to claim that they found the answer. Let us never be so foolish together, so much the thieves, that we fail to give disgrace to such people. Let us not believe that we preserve anything if what we preserve is in fact an illussion, or that we preserve anything by not reacting to what is changing when it becomes neccessary to act so that things change and how they change will be dependant upon what occurs, that understanding is required to react to what changes. But if they push anything beyond the human limit of what we can bear, than know that we are being asked to be mentally ill for some cause, and it is a cause for reason in the matter, that the one who supports chaos and foolishness is a hypocrite, because they wish to gain and exploit what they can to gain favour, and if they listened to them, the world would become closer to hell. But for those who are not to be taken seriously, let them not be taken seriously, and let those who wish to gain favour, and are not honest, not be taken seriously, when they know the truth about something. For many are seeking to gain the favour of others, and in their gaining they have what is in their heart, even hidden from them, that they do not desire for what they oppose to fail. Now if they wish to plunge the nation into chaos, they are capable, that they should be ignored, and that fools are abounding who have all manner of strange grievances, and so if they forbidding what cannot be forbidden than you know that they ask for chaos, that a traitor has wished to destroy the country, and if they will ask any to participate in what causes them distress and anxiety, know that they want the same, that it is a traitor who wishes to destroy the country by civil war. Now a civil war can be initiated in this way by a person who hates the country, wishing to put legislator through that will cause a civil war, and fighting to make it happen, that the country be plunged into civil war so that an enemy can attack while there is fighting and lay waste to the country. Do you think they do not wish for the destruction of the country because they are citizens, and not even immigrants? But there are some who have not identified with the country, and have not been loyal in their hearts, hating what they were brought up in, and wishing for the place to be destroyed, because another country is their preference, and they give their loyalty to something else that they consider to be greater than their country, and would rather that the country be destroyed, to rise again from the ashes, that a great reset happen on Earth, where all is done away with, that we might return to a different set of values and morality, and they are masquerading as supporters of other things, and it is even possible for the prime leader to be this, although I would not be of the type to be an alarmist, for an alarmist who is an agent of the government is a dangerous fool, who sees threats where there are none, and goes to war when there is nothing to behold that would be cause for him to even look again, or interupt his slightest motion, that indifference would be normal for him, or even her, that such is not a 'drama queen' but something entirely different, because one is not the same as the other, that any should justify the wicked, or place false weight upon one thing and no weight upon the other, that the person stumbles and falls into chaos. Now when it comes to those who cannot walk, because they have not learned to walk, I would not promote them to any office of consequence, if I might continue the metaphor, because I do not speak of physically walking with legs. But when you are in the physical prescence, and if you can walk you can bear it, of a police officer, and not when he reads what you have written, or in some other place you are to interact, than it is right for you not to use profanities, and this you understand, because you can not only walk, but run, and climb.
	But if a person can run and climb, perhaps they are capable of being in some office in which they might take actions of consequence to others.
	Now I have called this concept the two levels of common sense ability, and those who have the first are capable people and those who have the second as well are those who are capable of being given greater responsibility, that with every gain there is only what is required to mantain more, that if a person can mantain more, than they are capable with the added burden of what they would gain, and so it is, the later thing, impossible to judge what a person can mantain and cannot, because the later ability that I have not named, is not something that can be descerned by uniformitarian means, or by comparison to something else, so that if a person can be trusted with a little and given more, than they must be trusted with something, and this is not the business of men, but the business of God, that men not apply what is God's to some evil cruelty, that is carried out in wrath, that they be wise in their own conceit, but that such would not act wisely and reason with understanding, but departs from understanding. Now the one who is given something they were not worthy of is not always doing well with it, but if they were worthy, they are doing well with it, unless there be those errors that are understood by common sense, that people can go astray and do the wrong thing. So if any has been given the wisdom and understanding of the Judeo-Christian Bible, that was given to them without their effort, before their time, than it should be recieved with common sense, always, that a person is worthy of such a Bible.
	Now the leader who leaves a good inheritance for the next generation is being good, and so good comes from good to such an extent that he cares for all people and does not only seek favour for himself, but seeks to do what is right for his people, that a good shepard is not caring for himself to gain favour, but is caring for his people, and in this manner he is gaining good favour, and not favour that is from what is not good, and so then there is good favour that is from the Lord, and how could I know who he favours and who he does not? Now are a leader's actions not to be taken seriously, that they are dependant on what they do being delt with by others, that they would do the right thing that the leader will do the wrong thing to gain favour? But this is not a leader, and is not loyal to their nation. But if a child's actions are of no consequence it is only because of the parents and the adults, so that when an adult does such, it is then foolishness, so that if they have wished to remain a person whose actions are not taken seriously, who incur no consequences, than they must be that which can indulge this concept. Now a person who judges children is not a judge capable of judging any matter, because they are not holding back from doing that which is unjust, that they do that with children that is an exploitation, and are these not sometimes the same, if they are men, or even women, who are doing other things that are wrong? But the heart descerns the good and the evil, and if any judges children unjustly according to themselves, is it a small matter? But the one who judges children by right judgement is recieving that which is good in many things, that a wise woman is a precious jewal and more, and a good man is being called faithful, that those who can be trusted in one thing are not suspected of being untrustworthy in another. Now there is no contradiction in the concept of being able to be trusted with a little, and that if it is so, than a person can be trusted with more, and the problem is lack of common sense, that you not use the Bible to do what is not right, to rationalize what is not with understanding, that a person not depart from common sense. For those who can be trusted with a little can often be trusted with more, and if they cannot be trusted with the matter of judging children, than are they not suspected, even by men, to be untrustworthy? But not all who have failed with a little are failing with more, because the consequence for more is always greater, and so is the weight and consequence of those who would be a leader, that the weight is great, and what is occurring is taken seriously. Now if anything is to be taken seriously than there will be no hypocrite on the matter, that treating others as you would want to be treated is a fundemental of human sentience, as is the ability to know what is faithful and not a betrayal, that those who are trustworthy are capable of living and those who are not, are in fact betraying themselves, that the ability to be trustworthy in wisdom and righteousness is the ability to attain what is better, so that achievements are gained by being trustworthy, because the commitment is measured sufficient enough to mantain faithfulness as one seeks to acheive what is better. Now who are those who cannot even be trusted to remain faithful to morality with the large matters, such as terrorism, where they have gone astray easily, at times, and due to very little convincing compared with others, that they betray morality and the greatest restrictions of the world to do that which is unacceptable, and the cause is great pressure from various forces that act upon something, perhaps a less secure area of the planet, that a people feel powerless unless they attack, and so there is the case when one country does not realize how likely an event is to occur and do they then refuse to find more wisdom, to say they will not compromise by finding more wisdom? But it is very unlikely that given some of the cultures found in the middle-east and the impovrished state of some areas and their inability to match the military might of other nations, that terrorism will not result because of military incursions into those areas. If America does it, there might be a more likely chance of such occuring, due to the additional hatred of America due to past grievances. But if more wisdom can be found when attempting to defend a countries interest in the middle-east, than what is the cause of terrorism when these factors are not the case, and an idle people carry out terrorism for recreation, being idle in their lack of more expected targets for their attacks? The catagory of recreational terrorists seems to be reserved for those groups considered domestic terrorists by our governments in North America, who dabble in controlling what they do not have the right to control, and speculate in acts of violence, carrying out acts of terrorism when there is no more expected target for them, to a degree that it seems recreational, and does not seem to make sense. The truth of the Universe dictates that there must be a greater amount of motive in substance, that there is action for any action performed, and the same is true for any act of terrorism, because without motive there can be no action, and this I have called the greater principle which would dictate that if a person has commited two acts of crime against a person, due to anger, than they are likely to have enough wrath against them, or anger, to any other substance, to motivate them to commit a little over two acts against them, but if there is enough for three it is not known, only what can be claimed is there is at least enough for more than two.
	Of course if a police officer does not wish to help a person who has a problem that is easy to identify because they are having some wrath or hatred, than they are guilty of the crime committed, because they are sworn to do their duty, but if it is because they are not able to investigate for some reason, than the matter is absolved, and so is the transference of guilt in the Universe, that when a person is approached and told something than there can be a transfer of guilt where people share guilt, both being guilty, and this is the case in some cases but not in others. Of course people must know when it is so and when it is not so, and a person cannot be punished, except by God, for a crime they did not commit, and nor can they be judged by any person for it, or criticized for it. 
	Now if a person is judging a person who is not judging by the measure of evil they have committed, than what are they doing? But if they are judging for doing right, than what is the purpose? But intense hatred has brought forth that which a person cannot say, that they are with such an intense hatred that they commit wickedness and an abomination? By for those who have killed children, it is nothing hard to do, and for those who have molested children it is only a little more difficult for them. So they have said, it is wrong, but it must be done, and if they have not done either, than their hatred is intense. But the blood-thirsty are among the people, and they have nurtured rage with wrath in themselves, and they are not capable of knowing all the wrong that is known to others, only there is a measure of knowing what is wrong, that their anger is great, and the measure with which they would punish is from a lack of understanding, that these would give punishments that no person would, because they have followed the imaginings of the heart, to do that which is over the limit in what they believe others deserve. Now is Joab, from the Old Testiment, the man of justice and a brilliant general, not held to a higher standard, because of his actions? Indeed he would be, and he was not a hypocrite, for in the Old Testiment he killed two people when the situation was more questionable for what is understood by some, being that he made an example of a traitor who showed up very late for war, giving his allies a strategic disadvantage while an oppossing army did what they wanted, and he killed a traitor from the oppossing army, who part way through the war, having killed many soldiers from Joab's army, and David's, he walked into David's camp and joined them in a way that would be demoralizing to those who were still fighting, and doing good for David, he would not be killed by David, but being an offence to Joab, he was killed by Joab, and his brother was with him, when he killed him with a knife, doing that which is good, but not perceived by all, perhaps. How was this called wrong by David when he disobeyed David? Because of hypocracy, that would have been Joab's, but upon realizing what must be, he died willingly.
	Now when it comes to matters in which a person must be trusted with more and it does not come, so it comes, that if any is beyond what they are given, are they really not suitable, or is it another who might not be suitable, or are those less capable to claim some thing that is not, that does not have a name, not in my country, and not in my neighbour's, but if they are in some way not suitable for where they are, than what will anyone say that is not void? But suffer such when it is temporary, or such is the opinion, that they will be gone to a higher place soon enough, that if they cause you vexation, they will not when they have been given the province, for some are only anti-social in the time and place that they are in, and when they are given that place that is suitable for them, then they will do well, but of course the time and place of those who would be aquantances and friends will prove that a person is truly a fool when they attempt to do that which is utterly disrespectful, that you not add lies to truth, that is the delight of some who are fools and failing in some thing of virtue, that they desire to promote others to do wrong, to justify those who do wrong, and to defend them doing wrong, that in the good concepts, that the things that are right, they are for others doing wrong to others, even to their hurt, and if it should be amongst those who deserve praise, and they are willing and attempting that others do wrong to them, than in what thing they defend and promote, it will be counted as an action that they performed knowingly, due to hatred, and in the case of those doing well, very intense hatred. Therefore why will you be ignorant of the strange wickedness that occurs, but because it is strange and not happening often, you attempt to catagorize it as something that is close to it, that is an entirely different thing. But if people are doing that which has no name, even amongst Jews and Gentiles, than are they not doing that, when it is wicked, that is of great weight, being a great wickedness? But do not bring foolishness into something, which is in the works of evil fools, to push to the extreme what is right, and to remove common sense from what is true. For if a person wishes to harm a child, being an adult, and they deem themselves not capable, or willing, that they would wish another to harm them, than is this the same as giving bad advice due to jelousy, that is not for harming another person to whom the advice is not given? Because no harm is wanted in the matter of a woman giving advice to a woman, that another person who is not given advice is desired to be harmed by the person who gives the advice, that you not be ignorant. Now those who delight in speaking of wickedness to the one who is innocent, truly, as if it was a good thing, are full of hatred and injustice towards others, that they are not regarding right and wrong when they speak such, and if they speak such against those who are guilty, even then, they do not do good unto themselves. But truth and justice is pleasing, and no person is offended by the truth, only when they are, what can be the cause of such offence? But lack of understanding, when the truth is not given, is offering offence even to those who are very wise. Now if a person speaks words to only trouble a person, as if a weapon, knowing what is truth, than for what cause do they wish to attack a person, using that which they know to be false, and lies, as if a weapon in combat against someone? But such is not from most, and in whom it is found, the knowledge is there, that these are not like them who are to be exceeding in what is better. For there are those who hate themselves and hate others because of it, claiming they are of low self-esteem, but not having any reason for it, when no injustice has occurred to them, and some of them are thinking they have low self-esteem, and yet it is not the same as that low self-esteem that brings about hatred of others, that hates oneself, because they are of the holy people, and those who are on Earth for a time, that they might become even more so beautiful in the after-life, beauty to beauty, and what is made for hell, to hell.

We must kill all the ugly people even if they’re very pretty, or no person will live, and there is no group for them, for they are with any group, and they are not part of anything other than what they are. I do not speak of any group or any religion, because of the interpretation that is low. But those who are ugly are known, and they are not preserved in Heaven, because they are for hell and their place is hell that they would bring it to Earth. 

Be wise to the plots and schemes of ugly people, that where you do not see ugly people there are ugly people behind it.

There is the atheist of a different type who I have called anti-atheists who are not regarding the truth of their actions in what they do or do not do, but are only more in a nihilistic fashion, being that they are total anarchists at heart so that if the punishment is not at hand from people they have no guilt or remorse and they are for that morality therefore of animals that if one should die they are proud and if one should be injured and they are not they are proud. They’re lives are of no more worth than that of animals.

Why regard the rebuke of the animal and why fret if they are proud in their lowness, because they are insolent? But a human does not interact with animals that they might have any real grievance with them. Therefore as for the anti-atheist, there is no time to be troubled by them.

But there is the anti-atheist who goes to the street and when they find a home they are cast out again to the street. Now if they are belonging in this place than on Earth they have found the place for them that they are where it is fitting for them, but it is not always so with them that they are made homeless. For a human, do not allow it. For a human says it is only what people do, when they perform what is right when the action is not great. But there have been animals who are among society and not homeless, and do not be amazed, because the world has permitted it. Now a human is more wealthy than any animal because a golden covering of pure gold for an animal and a pen of pure gold is for a spectacle. Does the animal know tricks to do tasks? But the human is far more excellent than that and of greater wealth and they have nobility. Now the one who exalts the animal is a servant, because they dwell with the beast, in spirit, where they are kept in spirit, the animal being the servant’s friend. 

The anti-atheist animal attacks when weakness is detected, and does not save others when there is no danger to them and such is not considered without common sense that you not accuse others in matters where it is not always common for a person to meddle, for does not the animal attack where there is opportunity, where weakness is detected. For there is even an animal who cannot wait and attacks the moment they perceive an opportunity even when there is none, an aggressive animal and also in what an animal does it will not cease unless another stops it, even at times only if the right person stops it. Why do you fret over the actions of an animal? Do you not know that they are on Earth? But they are on Earth and have been on Earth.

Now why would an animal regard justice, or any person who did what was just? Must a person not defend themselves or be attacked again? But if an animal is indefensible how will they defend others? For the one is worse than the other who came later and the first better morally? If they would not regard justice it is so. But there are tigers, bears, lions, wolves, leapoards, goats, among the animals, and the same is true of those humans who are not anti-atheists. Now the lowness of a dog is perceived and yet are not beneficial to discuss the sacred things less they are defending in a way that does not consider that at times there is no offence, and so did the Christ call any any an animal? I would not believe he did. But a dog is not considering friend from foe and when there is no offence there is no need for it. Now are the children of God to be ignorant. But I would think there is truth, and He is the truth, but what he spoke to call any a dog is not that which I will try to explain only to claim that the reply might have forced Him. For who am I to speak for Him and what do I know? You are capable of knowing what He is. Now  what ability is there to speak for Him who is the truth? But does any speak for a man this way when there are words? But he was human and so who can say? Then is he scripture, that His actions, too, are scripture. But this exceeds myself and they attempted to judge Him. But if there is some saying that it is not good to give the children’s bread to the dogs but that the dogs also eat from the scraps of the child than the conversation seems different and I do not know. But if the woman here is evil but being humble, than am I deceived? But if one finds one thing and another finds something else, than are all correct that the message is for all the churches? Now I have not known the seven interpretations of anything. But should there be three I will be at peace on the matter.

Why does one swell with wrath and it is if they are sad but they are in injustice? But a strange wickedness is found in them and their actions are not in keeping with the truth, that is God. But wrath is weighty and if strange wickedness is found than why do they cause themselves to swell? But wisdom is beneficial and truth is good for strategy so that the one who would bring a person away from wisdom is not speaking in their best interest.

The one who is guilty says the injured is a failure, the victim is a failure and not more, that they have done me wrong, and not more, because they are in the pride of wickedness, the metal and dross, that they receive joy from punishing in their mouth that which better than them, because their hearts are for it, that they retaliate against the threat, that these would wipe out what is good so that they can be good, and it is not so, because they made themselves good when they were not and did not have guilt so that they would have the will to wipe out what is good. Now why does any justify the wicked by saying that they are something that is less offensive when they know the greatness of their wickedness? For the defence will partner with the wicked, and for what evil they committed will not be with them as guilt, because they are not capable of knowing their wrong, being those who cannot know it.

From the good comes good, and from the evil comes evil, and the heart of another and the actions of another are what they are. Now if Jacob did not attack the goats when he was being delt with wickedly to be robbed than for what cause does any attack the Jews? Now the one who attacks Jews with wickedness are those who would attempt to mutilate the child in God’s house and if they would do this to one who is not at war, how low they are and have admitted so in their hearts. Now if they desire peace, than must it be with God, that their anger towards what is not might be appeased? For did God give any of these people to be servants of the Jews? But some have become lothesome because they are not accepting knowledge of righteousness that is with those who would understand? But it is not the case, only they have not accepted righteousness that they know, and do also, that these are divided by another. Now if it caused by the other who divides than how will Israel have kings? But because the threat is great there must be an alliance, and the leader of Israel will be with the Allie that the allie might have its reward. Now how will the alleged enemies be for Israel if the allie is wronging them? Is this not impossible? But Israel is not to be divided by them when they are at peace with them and no longer hate them and make them to be like the lesser who gains a favour or gift. So there is not good towards Israel unless they should perish to what is less than they are, and would the one to be at peace with them be better for them? But a simple person is having wrath towards them because there is no reason for their hatred. But they learn and believe in simplicity that there is no reason required. Now what God has given he can take away and the son is not against the father, and should they cause the Jew to sin it is a wrong to God and if they cause a Christian to  go astray or sin it is also wrong. Now how cannot not be, without saying it, that God would not care about all people in this way and avenge those who are on Earth. But if you have sinned by reading you are not caused to sin, and neither by the acceptable speech of others, for if you wonder about such you have been treated exceedingly well, I think, less it be some confusion.

Wrath without judgement is from the wicked that there can be no end to the punishments that cannot satisfy it, but a righteous man departs in mercy, even when he would kill the wicked.

The one who forbids justice with force is doing justice and his hand is against another in this matter. Now if the hand that forbids justice is against the devil than what wrong is there? But does he honour God or the Jews when he delivers a wicked man over to be killed? But if the Romans gave the Christ over to be slayn, washing their hands of it, than in what guilt are you to be found? But you do not do justice or judge the wicked you do not know, that you have treated well, and yet you do not defend him further because he is guilty. Now what wicked man is judging this without judgement? Does insolence become righteousness when you have done more for the government than is good, when there is no king? But the mid-wives of Egypt would not kill the children and in disobedience to Pharoah because they feared God. But where there is no king there is no righteous judgment and the official who would do justice to the righteous has not feared God, but another God. I will not attempt to deceive in this matter.

Now by the false perception of a great Egypt, there is arrogance with those who use the might of Egypt, as they believe it to be, and arrogance as their argument. Now there is no Egypt at all among the people, unless it be the Sodom and Egypt citizens who are parasites to all. Now the small and insignificant group has placed forth a great expanding of what is not, and they are very few, that their argument is laughing and arrogance, and there is nothing by which they boast, except to preach their own doctrine.

Now if they speak words of soldiers than it is known they are in the battle, the soldiers with the anti-Christ that are knowing in their hearts that they are committed to fighting the children of God and God, that they know the battle and the sides and that they are for the anti-Christ that they might speak of doing battle with the house of God. Now where is there any knowledge of ethnicity in this thing? But do not be deceived about the reality of truth that there are many different ethnicities on both sides.  Now the elder brother is not so by ethnicity and neither the kings, that there not be foolish discord. But is the kingdom of Heaven to be divided when the kingdom of the devil is not? But the house of God is mighty. 

Now when it comes to crime none of their crimes are real and what anyone would do to them is real in their opinion. So is the war waged by one who seeks another’s blood, that they are restrained by prudence of consequences but they are for slaying those they hate. Now if they are so blood-thirsty, and some are, than for what cause do they add more war and attack when they are rebuked? But if they will add evil denial and insolence when they are rebuked than are they not departing from society to be as soldiers? For their anger and hatred is still committed to waging war when a person will not speak peacefully to rebuke to heed it. That they are still attacking with the intense hatred and the rage that would shed blood is still in them, that they are not for peace, but are still committed to their war, still continuing their attack in rage that they will not be satisfied until they have killed. Let not a righteous man feign ignorance that you not hold him accountable. For when there is war against the fellow citizen and the soldiers depart and will not defend, leaving battle, then the Lord knows what they are.

Now when the government defends those who are criminals against those who were attacked, do those innocent in the government not become criminals? But they are using foolish arguments that are void and nothing and do not change the truth, speaking calamities that are foolish and not reasonable for men, and they are then attacking after they have spoken such words, that they have rendered a reason but it is foolish and there are even lies, that they have only offered insolence, as words of foolish calamity, saying that which mocks because of its great foolishness, that these are being obnoxious and speaking in a brutal fashion that they mock and then attack, so that it is the insolence of one who will not listen to rebuke and with calamity refuses to reason as men who are in society, mocking the idea of reasoning, rejecting offerings for peaceful speech, that they are soldiers and still at war, and if they are waging war against you than is God not the God of war, that even in all the histories of the Earth, the Lord who is understanding all does not understand the ways of war and the devices used? But if they are against you because you have done well, than are they not on the side of evil? But you have been told to keep the law, and there is battle and a civil war? Does God not understand? Does He become deceived by their lies? But God is for what is His, and is this not selfish that He has called all to join Him? But I do not speak for God, and it is not for me. Only I would have you remember that if they think God is only in the internal than they would remember that He exists and is also God of what happens on Earth.

Now why will any trust Babel and its wise, for they are flawed and incomplete and it is a digression for consciousness, that reasons for what is only perceived might be expressed, that they do not offer wisdom but a language to express what is perceived by any. Now there are those who throw away inventions and great advances, and they act without permission and make themselves a burden to a people.

Now the one who would do that which causes torture before death of another, using combat acting to do so, is that person you cannot be ignorant of. For if nothing can be done in truth without compromising the person who was struck that they should endure torture and death than you will thoroughly kill the one who has done this act of cowardliness and wickedness and will not heed the words of fools who do not allow it when such is the matter. Now if an animal has gored a person than surely the animal will die to save the life of the person. But if the animals forbid it, they are powerless. For does God give the animals the will to go to war? But the holy people are not all and they are able to do what is right, when God’s hand is in it, that as one was delivered unto the devil to be killed, so you are a holy people able to judge, that men can judge and they are given such authority on Earth if it is God’s will. Now where it is not so, peace will be forced, that evil may cease. For the Earth is dangerous and there should be less violence when people use wisdom and some must be added that peace be greater and that there be less violence upon the Earth. For the angel will not heed the words of a king when God has spoken in truth. Therefore deliver this one unto the devil that they might be killed for they commit what the gentiles do not have a name for.

Now if there is a man among you who believes that there must be injustice if he is jealous, this one is not a man, and if he is then acting as if he was committing justice than with with what he does so all is guilt to him. But if he persists in this matter than he is like a sick bear that would wander about to mail and kill people. So there is pity with some, and yet he must die, being not a human when he persists in this fashion. So being men, holy ones, and Christians or not, you will not permit any animal to live for the life of a human, that you will be counted a human, and a holy one, who has power on Earth, when it is God’s will. For this power is greater than kings and it is upon the Earth, that it is not anarchy but exists with the strong and righteous words of kings and queens that the queen has come down to be like a sister to you, that her might is with you, that the king is without speech, and loved by God, and his throne is established with intense might and anger that is holy, that another crown appears with him.

Now the woman has respect of persons when the person is male, believing that the man is God, that he can change the truth. The truth is they can, or at least I can. I can do all of that.

Now serial killers have different methods and there is the type who slanders, saying that which is not so, feigning problems because of what did not occur, that they lie, and the one who does not question it but goes out to kill is their partner and a serial killer with them. Now here is a matter in which it was said that the one who slanders would be punished by what they attempted, when there are others who would heed their lies, that it is clear that actions would be taken, that it is not a light matter, and they have continued to lie. Now when a young girl does so regarding a boy, men are not ignorant as would be said, and the young man behaving honourable, and yet an adult has sought to exploit that which is to be robbed of them? Let it not be so that you will rob any, because of a despicable fool who seeks to exploit, to be against the young man. For it is not unexpected, and is for good, that the fool who is an adult will be identified and if he persists, than men are capable of putting away evil, that this power is on Earth, and not the law of Moses, but that which is put there by God, and the law of Moses, also, remains.

The killer of the innocent claims that no person who would know will take action, but the one no one will help has done the same. Now it is wise and moral to be prudent less you be called guilty of prejudice. Now a selfish fool, being a sociopath, does not regard life in what they do,  but there is a person of worth who will die for others. Now how will a selfish fool do what is right concerning others when they show that they care for no person in their disregard for any life. For a woman has done well, to fear God, to know limits, but a woman is not ever a selfish fool in any thing and yet the selfish fool will not cease because they will not respect anything and have no concern for any person.

An animal argues when their conscience has been bothered, and all manner of selfishness is found with them, and no woman is this, but a sociopath, a fool, that you understand the difference when they slander women.

Now what woman has such respect of persons that she brings that problem that she has not known against a man? But she has the respect for a such towards women as well because she does not know any. For this is one who is lacking much understanding, and as her respect is even great for women she does not understand the way between any man and woman for she does not know people and is not capable. Now a woman who is wise is unable to keep herself from perceiving what is wise and she is understand the truth.

Now the woman who teaches women anything concerning men is lower than her students that any of them can take all that she has. For she who would come between the woman who is their student and her husband is a servant to her who she would teach.

Now when a woman accused a man of that which only the wife can accuse him of then she is a servant to the wife for life. So it is by truth. Now if a man is using violent curses towards the wife is he being a husband? But a man doing such is not doing good for himself because she is his wife that he would do such when she has not been offending him in a like-wise manner that violence between the two is not beneficial. Now such violence is not like the other and so if they should become violent in the other way towards the other it is better that they would both be violent if it is the other way. Now if a man is hitting his wife, does he not suspect betrayal? But if he is not suspecting betrayal than is he the husband? Now there is betrayal because he has struck her? But I would think that the two do not get along with each other and are not suited to be married. Can such violence make them husband and wife? But if they are both wishing to go their separate ways and it is not a husband and wife than there is what they will and it is so. But if they wish to persevere for marriage than what can any person do? But let the man not grow overly jealous when there is no work and he must rest, for there is more work to come and places where it can be found. For I think he might dismay too quickly. Now the husband of the wife is with him always where she goes, and because it cannot always be so with the man, for he is not always capable of taking her, will he then be permitted to be with other women? But if his wife has not consented than he betrays her, and he has commited adultery, and the marriage, if she chooses so in the same manner of the man can become divorce because he has commited adultry. Now there is that which is not good, that cruelty become a problem for any so that God can restore, and is He not capable, and the Christ has died to save people, because the world was not capable of saving itself.

The one who exploits that they cannot be killed immediately, is one who should die, but those with virtues worthy of their life being spared, are not dying for lack of wisdom or morality. For death does not come immediately, and the one who calls for justice towards them is sinning against their own life. Now those who would scorn their own life are to be pitied in heart, although justice is because of actions and words that those who should receive justice are not judged by that which can be pitied because of what is void, but because of what they did before and did not do, that they did not seek wisdom or morality. Now when one dies and they should not they do not die but others perish and the one who should not have died, the justice spreads into the land, justice with truth, that God has sent justice like a plague so that the one who died still lives. Now as he was robbed so those who are guilty are robbed, that it is known by those who can understand. But where there is another thing then who can say what will occur? Now if it is not from Moses than what is it? But truth is understood and let the truth be said to be true where it is right to say it.

A fool has wished to carry out evil so much that they have said, I have no defence or it is small, but the one I hate is unprotected and none will fight with them. But because of lack of knowledge and understanding they have no prudence and the other type is not followed by them, that without understanding they cast their life away, and is it then to be pitied by fools? But they have committed error within them that they believe such about the world, because their foolishness cannot be changed by them. So fools have died and there are those who did not die because of lack of wisdom or morality, but some have died because of the cowardess of a worthless fool and then it is not the fool who killed them, because the fool was not enough for it, but the Universe took them, that their time of being on Earth was over.

The guilty are compelled, but a righteous person is not cruel, and the one who exploits the grief of a woman is like one who takes the bread and blanket, that they speak perversity, and the woman should do justice. Traitor to them who was slayn and their memory! But is the woman to slay the guilty or the innocent? For where is a wicked fool of this type who would ask such of the woman I would think them innocent because the knowledge of their innocence has brought about a perversity that this is the perversity that it brings forth. Now such perversities are from knowledge that is other than what is said.

Now should anything you cannot speak be said? But in matters of crime I would think so, although whether it is true is found out with wisdom and prudence because haste is bringing an accusation of bias. But what is not to be said may not be right to say another way, unless you would consider government censorship or some great consequence for speaking truth. But if any have not sought to conceal and you do not understand why do you make an accusation that they are evil? Is this a belief that some have? But those who have respect of persons are not having what is good, so that such seems to bring about other problems that are not wanted. Can any good come from what is not that the products be good but the source is not. Therefore you are known to be something that is considered not well and such can be brought to the psychologist, whose ways and words are found strange and with truth but going astray. 
Now what is the power put on Earth? But it is the power of a holy people who are aknowledging God, that they are not Jews but it does not seem right to call them Gentiles. Now there are many different people groups and the people who are acknowledging God have with them a holy acknowledgement of God that they are not low, but there are many found among them. Now the ones who are lower among them are from another people group that dwell with them, and even the group that is animals dwells with them. Now the pety and small matter between the Jews and Christians is to be understood for that which does not cause any separation between them, for they are both loved. Now there are those people who are not Jews who are not capable of having the greater knowledge of what they do and if this group also dwells with them are they to be considered representatives of another group? But it is good for them to understand the many people groups that dwell with them that such is not about ethnicity because this is not the way they are different. So the angel has come to turn brother against brother and parents against children and children against parents? But if this is so because of truth than it is not regarded for me, because to give understanding is what is regarded by me. Now there are the people groups of ancient times even that not all among them could have been what they were, and there was that wisdom of one who would place an additional burden upon those who had come there from another people that the people might benifit from them and the rebuke be taken because as they could have departed for another place at any time they desired to be in Israel so that they would lend their labour in addition to living their lives in that place, and the saying that is cruel was spoken by his son and yet he did not chastise them with whips and they choose to stay and have the additional burden. Now when the generation passed was there to be any additional burden? But God is not a fool and not wicked. Therefore you know what is right that when rebuke is righteous there is God who is capable of delivering justice to those who do wickedness. Now would they have spoken foolishly if the opportunity to give payment for their dwelling there not been given by that king? For the rebuke holds truth that has a weight too much to bear for one who has honour and yet is unable to do what would fulfill their place. Therefore the one who speaks it is speaking to another who has not been made capable. 

But if any is offended by those who speak truth, to attack them in any way, they are in hell, and are to go there because it is where they are. For the kingdom of hell is having many who are on Earth, and if nothing is declared to them and they are even offended by words that are peaceful, being offended by truth that is not offensive to any who have honour and understanding, than these are in hell and going to hell, that their master is the anti-Christ, and if nothing was declared to them and yet they offer their voices to the messenger even, than it should be known that there will be a great divide between heaven and hell that they will not be able to trouble God’s people with their death, pain, and misery that was in their heart on Earth, because they were the servants of the devil.

But if any soldier who is sworn to protect you being given a command from the king to protect you, and if he is going to the son or daughter who he has been commanded to protect and he is slandering them in accusation in his heart and condemning them with slander and attacking what is praise-worthy to the nation, and supported, that he is treasonous, than this is not loyal to the king or queen, and the queen will violate him with her might, and the king will utterly crush him, for so much as he condemned righteousness in two ways that he betrayed God and Ceaser both to attack one who pleases both and was doing what was pleasing to both, so his member will be removed by righteousness and he will be unseemed from the knave to the chap, and your children will walk upon him in spirit because he will be ground to ashes. Now if he is stubborn and stiff necked he is not a Jew, and if he is attacking those he was commanded to protect that he would cause them to sin, he is then with the false prophet and even the devil has been wiser than him in his disobedience. For he is stiff necked by his entitlement and self contained in his willing ignorance that he does not regard the king or queen and does not regard God. Now this is one who partners with the devil to commit evil, and what he has been told to protect he seeks to kill and what he has been told to defend he seeks to destroy that he would destroy the land that he is in rebellion against that he might inherit it for himself, when there is none to be with him and he has a country against the nations. For he is strong by his ignorance that he wills and he is more insane than any by his ignorance and actions. If he has attacked even the angel and God than he is even the one who has a mill-stone tied to his ankles that he would sink to the bottom of the Ocean. Therefore rebellious fool do not concern yourself with a stiff neck that heeds no rebuke by ignorance for as you have betrayed all and are in treason against all you will receive worse than what you have done.

Now your loyalty is to the king or queen and when any scoundrel should make his way into the government do not be amazed, because they are an imposter and such has occurred since the beginning, that the imposter puffs up to lie to the sons and daughters of the kingdom, saying to the children of the house, that I am having the right and am king of the land or queen, for though your parents are away, they told me it was so. Now the person bears a sword against the children while their parents are away and has snuck into the house where he was not permitted to be that he would do that which is wicked, being a dog who has swelled with ignorance and iniquity, rebellious and exceedingly wicked, and he attacked the heirs who were in loyalty and did what was pleasing to the king and queen, and he attacked what was good and noble in the land that the children did, spewing blood from his mouth, reviling what was good and holy, and he reviled what was upright and good, hating what is noble, that is of palaces and places of learning, that he clothed himself in chains to show his strength and frighten the children, that he clothed himself even in heavy chains of ignorance, and he spoke with dirt and blood in his mouth, and drooled venom.

They are only sorry after they have killed the Christ and before though we moved a continent from one side of the Earth to the other they would not listen to reason, they would not repent, but shut their ears to be stupid, closed their eyes to be ignorant, that when the Christ was dead they repented and said, I have done wrong but deserve no punishment because I was not capable of knowing and repenting that though he forgave the Romans the head of Judas exploded with blood, and though he forgave the Romans the Pharisees were for killing him. Now why are you to be deceived to take what is said to one to be given to the other. For though one criminal would be with him in heaven the other is speaking iniquity? Now are the words of his forgiveness meant for all when it cannot be that one is like the other that you should commit blasphamy by speaking what is a profanity when His words are used for others? But one who kills is for killing when he is full of rage and wrath and shuts his ears and shuts his eyes, that his rage is full and his ignorance great and willingly so, because he does not judge by truth but by his own wrath and rage, because he is following his own heart. 

The wisdom of David being that of an angel, being that which Joab would adhere to, has said to the afflicted words of kindness, has defended the prophets and what is holy, has been like an equal with the angels, to fight as one of the angels, to cast out the rebellious, to slay the wicked who feign justice.

For what is this thing, but is David an angel? Because his wisdom is among the angels.

They are only sorry after they have killed the Christ and before though we moved a continent from one side of the Earth to the other they would not listen to reason, they would not repent, but shut their ears to be stupid, closed their eyes to be ignorant, that when the Christ was dead they repented and said, I have done wrong but deserve no punishment because I was not capable of knowing and repenting that though he forgave the Romans the head of Judas exploded with blood, and though he forgave the Romans the Pharisees were for killing him. Now why are you to be deceived to take what is said to one to be given to the other. For though one criminal would be with him in heaven the other is speaking iniquity? Now are the words of his forgiveness meant for all when it cannot be that one is like the other that you should commit blasphamy by speaking what is a profanity when His words are used for others? But one who kills is for killing when he is full of rage and wrath and shuts his ears and shuts his eyes, that his rage is full and his ignorance great and willingly so, because he does not judge by truth but by his own wrath and rage, because he is following his own heart. Now if they are cast out is it by the cross? For did Christ die for all? Indeed He did, and so these who fought against Him, against the prophets, the holy ones, against what is good and noble, are cast out by the cross?

Now did the angel know that David was not an angel until after the fighting? But is he, David, an angel, because it is hard to know.

Now what do I know about David but I suspect he will return. Now was his wisdom exceeding my own? But if Joab chose him than how will the devil cause any discord? But no discourse is there and what they fear who they respect is not my business only I know that if they fight against truth than I will say I cannot fight if David is not with me to fight. 

They are only sorry after they have killed the Christ and before though we moved a continent from one side of the Earth to the other they would not listen to reason, they would not repent, but shut their ears to be stupid, closed their eyes to be ignorant, that when the Christ was dead they repented and said, I have done wrong but deserve no punishment because I was not capable of knowing and repenting that though he forgave the Romans the head of Judas exploded with blood, and though he forgave the Romans the Pharisees were for killing him. Now why are you to be deceived to take what is said to one to be given to the other. For though one criminal would be with him in heaven the other is speaking iniquity? Now are the words of his forgiveness meant for all when it cannot be that one is like the other that you should commit blasphamy by speaking what is a profanity when His words are used for others? But one who kills is for killing when he is full of rage and wrath and shuts his ears and shuts his eyes, that his rage is full and his ignorance great and willingly so, because he does not judge by truth but by his own wrath and rage, because he is following his own heart. Now if they are cast out is it by the cross? For did Christ die for all? Indeed He did, and so these who fought against Him, against the prophets, the holy ones, against what is good and noble, are cast out by the cross? But do not think I mention the Jews, because those who do good are good and those who do evil are what they do, that if any is to be cast out by the cross how great would their iniquity be or what would they be to be cast out? Now David fought against the soldiers on Earth, given the task of defending the citizen, of keeping the commands, who would attack what is noble, what is good and pleasing, and David was defending the place of prophets and the places of learning where people were pleasing God, defending the holy priests and the noble ones, those who seek wisdom he defended, and fought as an angel, and Joab would be with him, because Joab chose him. And his innocence was for defending the poor, and he fought those who would attack God, who would attack the holy. Now if he is returning is he an angel? But his wisdom is not less than that of angels, or so the angel he fought with thought. But how is it the one who is with the false prophet because he betrays God and Ceaser both is outside all, having betrayed all and committed treason against all that the soldiers are not even ashamed of him because they cannot identify anything of themselves with him.

Now if these soldiers are stiff necked and entitled and they are not as most, than what cult is this they have formed? But they are what is called a narcissist and entitled and being entitled to what others have done, that is not them, and others have won for them righteousness and it is not theirs? But they have eaten of what is not clean, being the pig even that they have eaten of, and is it right to accuse the righteous one’s of this? But they have eaten the blood with the meat, and eaten of all that which is not good for them to eat, being a stiff necked people that are utterly filthy, and wickedness is to be mixed with strength because they are righteous by spirit and that spirit being the righteousness of others. Corrupt and criminals and garbed in large black chains and crowns of iniquity and cruelty on their heads that their glory is the horror of hell, and they are even perverse in heart that they profane and commit blasphemy. Now these are not Jews but of a cult that is on Earth, and they do not regard any authority that is above them, and they are corrupt, and their arms and hands are corrupt and their legs and feet are corrupt that their bones are riddled with small holes and decay, and they are rebellious and so against God, against those holy places where they do not belong, where even by their fraud that they gain titles on Earth, they have sought to attack where they have no place, in holy places, to cause the pure to sin, to cause the righteous to go astray, that they are self-righteous and claim the kingdom of God for themselves because they will not co-exist, they will not stand back and allow the things of God. They have claimed justice and righteousness by self-righteousness and seek to kill those who are in the kingdom of God, because they are of another kingdom and what is of another is an offence to them.

Now did I perceive it from others, that they would call out against the cult that if you will be someone as that, so that you can be righteous by your cult, to cause others to sin, that you are so chaotic and brutish that you are like a device of the devil, than you had better keep away from our citizens? Now if the men have said it does the power of the cult turn it to condemnation of the righteous men who are citizens to say in their heart, those of the cult, that they are criminals who would rebuke me, even though they are not. But such is the power of the cult that would maintain the strength of ignorance as a warring cult, that goes to war with any who would speak truth, who would please God, that none should proclaim any truth when they can hear or else the power of the cult will bring them to hatred of truth, that it is not of the cult, that those who speak any truth are to be killed or that war will be against them, because the truth that is with God is not of the cult that they hate those who speak truth, even those fellow soldiers who are not part of their cult, even the king if he speaks truth and is the queen an offence to them or are they great by their cult that her might does not offend them? For the queen is to be defended by the righteous and she is for them, and let it be so that no person should attempt to deceive her that she incline to them and be pulled down and trampled, for the men of Earth will pick her up before she can be taken down that the prudence of such might not be required so that they should know what this, the cult, is.

Now I would not want any to be deceived. But can you sell one thing for another with the devil and he will not take both sometimes? But would you sell your inheritance for money and money, too, you will not have. Now if it is benificial for repentance do you think that it must have been God who took money from you that you might repent? But do not be as the outrageous who are believing in the devil that if you are more evil he will give you more money and material gain. But would he give the kingdoms of the Earth or go back on the commitment. Now you reason that he is honest in what he offers? But the kingdoms of Earth are worthless and the kingdoms, do they belong to the devil? But envy and hatred is having what substance it does, and what is with God, is it not better? Now do you believe that David’s heir is a cult unto money? Do you think that Joab is an enemy to him? But if any has given you poison by any means than does God not judge this thing? But if you are knowing that He is real than you are believing in that which has power in the Universe, and if you are for Him to act with what you say in a moment do you not know that if they send some they will have to be consumed twice? But if God has power and he defended Elijah than is He not for defending you, who are of great worth to Him? But if any on Earth should laugh or mock do they not know the battle does not come in ways they can perceive it as if it should be in the air and on land that if they believe they are powerful in this way even against God than they would know they do not perceive in ways they can understand, so that they would remember Him, that they, too, must be saved by His son.

Now you reason as an unholy people in this matter where you say if my government has done evil secretly and I do not know it that God will not do justice upon all because it is not any God who is in heaven and God does not care for what some have done who acted against others, who did wickedness. Now do you think that any other group is then speaking for God when they do wickedness against the innocent? But if you have no prophets to tell you will you respect God if they proclaim things to you? But how will any know for what reason anything has occurred if there are no true prophets to proclaim truth to you? But what manner of people are you then? Are you to be called Luke-warm and yet many of you are hot and many are cold? But a fool has proclaimed atheism for God because they could not bear truth, because they would not be speaking against what they perceived to be something difficult for them. Now what will they say if they indeed hungered for truth and it was denied to them, and they would have been glad to have it? But one says your debts are forgiven and it is not like one who says it is over there when it is in another place and accessible to the one who would go there. But is God not real? But they have claimed by their belief that there is no God, and that there is only a little and that it is not all. Now if your people have no prophets is it your fault? I do not believe it is, because some desire to have knowledge, whether good or bad. Now do you understand that God corrects those in his house and if a father is correcting his child who dwells with him does a fool outside laugh with foolish joy, saying the child is evil, when the fool is cast out into utter darkness and misery and the child is corrected because of what benefit and good is planned for them. Now it is a great honour to be corrected by God, that no person fail to understand and speak foolishly without knowing. Now if you are saying it is theocracy do I weep? Do I feel guilt because of it? But there are those who want communism and those who want monarchy and you would expect me to be concerned by the knowledge that would be given to greater benefit and advantage? But in what manner leaders would be placed there is not written by me. What it is to be is not known by me. 

A fool has done much evil and rages when questioned, and this being a belief of persecution, but there can be no insolence where a person is conforming to reality, to truth.

The one who blasphemes a proverb in words and deed against another, is not a son or daughter of the kingdom, but a servant in some unseen place, the one who is not counted among the heirs.

To regard right and wrong is a God of some people, but the bias accuser has believed there are no limits to a person.

A fool recieved knowledge and they changed it into calamity and foolish wickedness, that they might judge the people with their calamity and foolishness, that they might pour out their wrath, because they are like those who cannot even walk yet in their capacity to judge, that they stumble and cause catastrophe, that they are an evil and stumbling fool of calamity, that they are not children, but adults, who cannot walk in matters of judgement, that knowledge has been changed into foolishness, that they removed common sense, and they lacked understanding from the beginning, that some have even joined doctrines that they were not worthy of, that even in the foolishness of the doctrines, they could not be worthy even of the doctrines that they were unable to follow and that they changed into calamity and foolishness. A wicked fool! A stumbling calamity! For he has wandered about, lost, even innocent because of his ways, that he is not even hated at times.

When a person has abandoned morality by their own confession to themselves and even to others, not regarding it by choice, they confess that they have abandoned reason and wisdom by choice, and so why is their opinion to matter? But a person can not have it both ways. Now sentience cannot be abandoned so if they have given up and abandoned they cannot abandon sentience that if they would attempt to judge with an unjust balance, than exceedingly great is the fault in them that the balance is so greatly weighted to one side, being a balance that is not to be weighted at all before a thing is placed upon it.

But if the person is for what is better than why do you take them among you? But if it is so that it must be, than will you not attempt that all should have what is better. But let many things happen when no person is being attacked, when no other person is troubled, because understanding is permitting and keeping away from that which must happen at times. So a king has said, can the people bear it if it is so? But the one who acts with wrath against their people are those who are for other things. But where there is wrath against the people from the king or queen than there is wrong that is done. Now if there is not wrong by truth than the judgement is not seemly. 

A fool has said, because they came to me for help I will be the judge of the entire Earth in this matter, that it is my decision, and this is one who is guilty of what they say is not wrong, that they have not behaved as a citizen, but as the judge of the planet, because even a judge, even the leaders, cannot do what they have done.

When the option was presented, he would do that which no person would do, that is beneath an animal, because he came upon a group that was doing this thing, that he might partner with, and pardon what they did, and this, too, cannot even be done by a judge or leaders. What is done in secret will be known. What has been done where no one heard, will be shouted from the roof-tops.

But you do not give an elderly man all responsibility when he is elderly and lacking a strength of his youth, that he is stronger in other ways, but not to be given all responsibilities that are for those who are younger. But their wisdom, the elderly, is stronger in other ways, and at other times, they are lacking ability to understand something, or deal with something, and yet in other ways they are wiser? For this is a strange thing among people, that there are those who cannot do that which the younger can do, and yet in many matters they are more capable than them to give wisdom, and yet in some matters of understanding the ability is with those who are younger.

If many should join hands, should partner in something, being a group of them, and one throws a stone, and the other passes them the stone to throw, so all are guilty of what the group has done, and not any of them can go unpunished, that you not dismay in heart, and say, they are fools, they are like children who do not know, but children are not capable of this thing, indeed not physically able due to what they have been given, and so you will know that depths of such an abomination, that they are not all partners who are nearby, that those who partner with the evil that they did, to kill the innocent, to say that those nearby, or those not with the group in some way are partners as well, are then being partners in what was done by such a group, are those who are not for justice, but are with the evil that was done, because the evil is not finished. But for all those who are guilty then you will remove them from the Earth, and you will not spare any of them, because of the victims, and all the victims on the planet, who all must be protected, and all those who would be victims, being all, who must be protected, that you cannot pass over what has been done. So when a parent is protesting, did they not know that their child was evil? But surely they would know, because those capable of this thing, if you truly understand, are not like others who are on Earth. Now those who partner with such a group are doing that which is of the standard of the evil, that they are not innocent, that they are judged by the measure of what the evil was, because they were for doing justice in what they did, and the measure of justice is being unjust and wicked, that this is a great measure of justice.

There is one, by the guilt of their actions and the level of the wickedness they did, lowers themselves to the level of their wickedness that they did, lowering their standard of morality, but one who would repent, who would seek to do no more wrong, is one who is living by righteousness when they live.

Now Jacob's older brother had many things more than Jacob, and many more opportunities, and yet did he have more? But let them all be Jacob, and there be no sibling for them, that the Christ is Jacob, and his younger sibling is Jacob, that Joseph is stealing Benjamin, because Benjamin was pleasing to God, that Judah, a king among them, would be garbed in what was to be given to Joseph as well, that they would not know a law for righteousness, but by no command, and only guidance, they are not being what is called judgemental by the standard of what is known as judgemental, since those who are judging are not judgemental, but those who exceed, these are judging by a standard. But if any is less judgemental, are they not doing what the Christ said? But there is no addition to the scripture, and words of wisdom are already among them. There is no command given, and the proliferation of wisdom is already known by them. There is nothing forbidden in it, and there could not be.

There is a type of sensitivity that requires a person to go so far as attacking a person in some way, usually by words and some non-violent and offensive deed before their guilt will disappear which becomes a routine of some who are not well, although they are capable of performing every task they must, and such are not well and require much if it is consistent and happens due to small wrongs, that such as they must retaliate even when it is unknown to the other where offence has come from. 

Then a person was abused within that place, and those who did it deserved to die, and they gathered and said, kill them and throw their head out to us, that they might be killed because those who did this thing deserve to die, and the soldiers even of that place would not throw their head out to them, any who had done this thing, and so they went away and gathered an army and returned, because in such matters there is civil war in the nation, and the soldiers of that land who were for defending righteousness in the land had betrayed the nation and they were wicked and stubborn, and would not throw their heads out who had done this thing, or go into that place to kill them, for they were hardened in heart and cruel, and so the righteous went to war with them, and cut them down, the soldiers and the leaders of that place, and all who would defend what was wrong, and they killed them as if they were people of Sodom, and they killed those who had done that which had been the cause of the war, and they took the cities that belonged to them, and so even when the king had come, to say that it could not be, they did not heed him, but returned to their places when justice had prevailed, when the acts of God and righteousness had been done.

If it ever needs to be stated and I am not sure it would, Abel is not jelous of Cain he only does not want to be attacked anymore by him, disabled by his kind every time he is succeeding, and murdered by him. For Cain, not regarding any rebuke and not caring for his reputation much, for when he is already hated, it matters not to him, is coming again to the flocks of Abel, to attack and kill what he can, because of his great jelousy, but Eve and Adam are gathering up Abel, to nurture him, because he is loved, and so God has accepted his sacrifice.

Now The Diary is for the church and the other is for understanding the enemy, that it is not for society and offers no guidance but is meant for understanding the war of the anti-Christ against God. It is not for rebuke or correction and holds no command for to use it this way would be to bring the war of the anti-Christ into your midst to be the fighting of the devil against God in your lips. But if any would wish to read it than they will understand that it is not part of any religion, and not part of the church that it cannot be used or qouted by any, because it is like a religion from hell that you reject and that is against God only it is read as the religion of the devil who is against the Christ and God, as if an peaceful country that has an enemy and has snuck into the country to bring back scrolls from their wicked religion that we might know their evil and ways if they would fight against us. Therefore why would any quote wickedness, although it is not presented in a manner of wickedness that it is not wrong to write or read being the knowledge of those and their ways who do not always wish to live in peace.

Now is it sometimes so that those considered the most base, the lowest, the worst, by truth that belongs to God, are to be some of the most dangerous to you? But is it not so? Yet all from hell are dangerous to you. For some of them charging and attacking in battle, others assisins, others archers, others bombers,  others splinters, others recruiters, and better to be a recruiter of God, others Captains, Generals, and some in the behaviour of beasts that you may not know, who dwell on Earth in the appearance of people, and their ways are unknown to you, and some spirits on Earth evil, to deceive, and some ways meant to place one under an allusion that is false, and those evil that they are learning from evil, but a good person rejects it, and all those other ugly things that soldiers of the devil, weapons of the kingdom of hell, things that ugly. For even some things that might seem beautiful have been revealed later to be ugly, and those on Earth create stories and act people who are not real without attempting to deceive any, that most of these are beautiful, so that from hell has come much uglieness, and it will be defeated and thrown back when there will be no escape. Now those who understand at an average level are at the deep level, and the beautiful are these and it was unknown to some, but not that understanding they speak of but the one that is for wisdom, and an ugly person is not capable, less he has power, to understand the beuitiful, and if a man has this power let him be given more power and a woman can become one of the beaituful.

Now do you not know you are not of this world but are of the kingdom of God that has the afterlife and is known to them who are in it. For besides those who would slay you, there are other people groups that were not stated and some of these are difficult for you to understand. Now the entrath are a people who do more of what they are called that they cannot abide being called any mean name, being not acceptable as it is most times for you of the kingdom, and the Entrath are a sensative people who when a person speaks good of them, they are for being good to them. But to call a Entrath a name begins war often with them, and yet they are not often for violence but are for peace. Therefore if an Entrath is in fighting with you speak well of them to those they are judged by that an Entrath might be good to you and want peace. Now are the Entrath not actually a kind folk? But their kindness is with them and their mercy towards humanity, only they are a sensative folk and in gentleness and strength in what they must do. Why will you offend them? But be defending yourself and always standing up for yourself knowing that they are also not to be damaged, for will you maul a bird because it pecks you while you interact with it? So is my advice on the Entrath. Now what are the wolves and are any good? But there are wolves who are for you and those against you and those who are peaceful with the beautiful are not some of them beloved? But what is on Earth is always in two races. Those of heaven and those of hell. Now the Elves are the kingdom and it is understood that those of the church where I reside must be Elves. Now I jest, because I do not call them Elves but refer to a story which is loved because the truth that is real is in their hidden hearts and because of some closer proximity and because they are God’s or meant to be, they like this story. But the beautiful people are immortal being in the way of life and having eternal life and the ugly have already perished and perish again. Now what is the case of those who have been told they must perform something and it becomes like a wrong meddling for them in another people group and they are having an unwellness in the eyes of God because of it, and a sickness in his house, like a child who has gone out one day and eaten berries that were not permitted, so that they would then be in a safe place when they are able and if His son is a physician than is the Lord not capable. But I know that when God wills it He is casting an Island into the Ocean and that we are not God and we are not a law of righteousness but are seeking to obey him and having no law, so that He is in control and the truth has power over the Universe.

Now the one who might commit wrong for another, breaking the laws of man, are like the soldiers on Earth and it is done for God, because the soldiers should have performed it and a life must be saved. Now is this one scorned by the righteous? But is it not those of the enemy who are among you who might scorn it? But a friend has been deceived by lies shown and told that they might have wrath when they will understand? But the enemies are in the realm of war and will not accept justice and neither will the soldiers who are traitors. But the soldiers do this thing when it is right and when they must be loyal but they are good will you truly resent them and be against all of them, those who are not traitors? But it is not even good to use profane speech before such soldiers and will you be turning against God when the time has come to return to peace? But always know that not all were traitors and that they too are endangered by those who are wicked that they may have fought far more than you for what is right. Now will you wish them all death? But when there is then peace and a return to peace than more will be gathered to be worshiping God.

Now people who are comparible to a type of creature on the planet are not animals, of course, and this known. But when they are comparible to a creature and people of the kingdom or human but not people of the kingdom this is what was only assumed. Now do you think that when a race is mentioned they are actually some creature and not a race? But if you believe I do not know that you are free, and also from me, because I do not attempt to defend what I offer, only I would not want confusion. But does any think a thing prior mentioned is another thing or that two things that are different are the same? But would this not be very unjust and towards what is good and God’s because it is something I have not told you about and you think it is something that it is not? But when Adam was in the garden the Lord brought to him every creature and if he can tell the difference to name that which he has not been told of than his children, too, can do this thing, so you not be made disabled by what you might have assumed and do what is not just, for I do not give you all wisdom and knowledge of the Universe.

Now it is good that any should want the Christ to return while they have not carried out their years in this phase and those watching do not do so in a pointless way because it is with faith in what is true. Now if heaven is to be granted on Earth where a New Jerusalem will be do they not desire to be citizens? But there is one even better than some angels in this way and do you not know that He even finds fault in the angels? But if you are desiring some cult that is in the world, being some kingdom, than if it is belonging to the devil and those who follow him are going towards hell, is it then wise to be exhaulting yourself and what wrong kingdom you are in? But I would prefer that people be in the kingdom of heaven, that they be truly prudent in this phase.

Because not understanding he spoke already in ignorance words not able to be used for peace, and one who was not understanding even took action that he might do violence. Now one considers and it is private for them and they cannot be judged but those who act before they understand are not to be considered of no fault because they did not understand.

Now are the commands meant for war or for peace? But if you do not fail at this you might recognize the ability to judge at a small level.

Now if there black people who are sensative are they not also sensative for you? But the one who is considering serious things and treating them as if serious, are they not to be favoured for this, when their wisdom is shown in the time when it is shown? But if you are guarding your sisters because of this consideration that is the physical ethnicity than will you consider yourselves to be knowing what the one who is not doing so is? For this discord is becoming ugly in small ways and perceived by the wise who are with those doing well. But can this evil be with you if you are people of the kingdom? Indeed it shows that some have not understood and a place is having division and yet no great evil that they would discuss it because you do not consider the wise, because you do not regard the better standard. For you are for gaining wisdom and yet do not regard it when there is a matter for the wise? But only when such is defiled by wicked criticisms is there anything wrong in it. But know that injustice is understood and that the wise women of Egypt were fearing God even so far as to risk their lives and this is not also true of the Egyptian men? But indeed it is true and it is not the physical ethnicity you ever deal with in problems but only what is true in the eyes of God.



Considering the evil of some who are ugly, who do that which is an abomination, themselves being abominations, one can imagine that for a person who is not ugly to be attacked by Cain or another version of it, to endure attempts to deprive a person of what they have worked harder for, having delt with more bitter envy and resentment that does not judge fairly, who are objectively more intelligent than any person who would require some recompense for being ugly, being low enough in wisdom and intelligence to believe that life should be fair in the matter of them having the portion they have chosen, and not what any has said is their right, or that God has chosen, or the Universe, that they should believe life has to be fair to the extent that they be more intelligent than beautiful people, and no person ever gave them this as a recompense for their lack of beauty, so that if a person believes such, are they not a fool and lacking much intelligence? For this, of all things, intelligence, and not some other thing, something even better, would be the recompense for their assumed lack of beauty, as they would choose it for themselves. But believing they are not beautiful in any way, they refuse to be beautiful in any way, and hating themselves and others, they are homicidal sicophants, who do not want sympathy any longer, as would have been offered to them, but only to exact their rage upon the planet, that something within them, has called them to their destruction, and their hearts have said, “If no person will destroy me, because I lack than I will cause myself to attack.” So they have reached a self-destruct mechanism that even goes so far as to begin to attack others when no person will attack them. But the beauty that is to be given to the beautiful in heaven is surpassing their beauty, and if one chooses to be ugly because they are ugly, than to a place of pain and anguish, and greater misery, they will go, to suffer for all eternity, while beautiful people, the children of light, dwell in heaven, not able to be troubled by their misery. For they have chosen the imprudent way, being base, and without much understanding, believing in the lie of their self-hatred, and not being wise to prepare for the beauty they would have in the after-life, which is forever, in sentience and being what is good. Now all this is not beautiful is not always so perminantly, as is understood, but that if any has caused beauty to go astray, it would be better for them if they had never been born, for the land is for beauty, and what is wise is moving towards that which is beautiful, being an afterlife where there is to be a great seperation between heaven and hell. But the land is plagued with the eyesores that burden those who are beautiful, who seek to pull them into their misery, that what is miserable is so because it is ugly, and attains greater uglieness that a holy people walks upon the land, in preparation for the next life, storing up treasures for that time in the first phase, so that the next will have what is attained, being those sentimental things of beauty, and so let the beautiful be given more, that the one who has more will be given more, and the one who has nothing, even that, let it be taken from them, because what is gotten that removes riches in heaven is not profitable, that riches in heaven should be with riches on Earth, that the two will be both had, and that the riches of heaven are better, as they are to be had in the next life, when the phase is over, and the transition has happened, that repentence for wrong is not of those who rage and are blood-thirsty, to shed the blood of what is pure, but is for those who have true remorse, that they have sinned, and might attain a pure garment of white, being given pure linen, and clothing of light, that they might attain life, and be brought to eternal life in heaven, so that those who hate themselves, who seek to war against God, they are for hell. Now wisdom has attained what is better, and those who are seeking wisdom are seeking something that is pleasing to God, so that my diary is written, my theories offered, wisdom given if it is so desired, that The Diary of Lucifer is that which from upon the throne, but not of the Christ, but where satan is not, being the name of the serpant that existed in a very ancient time, that the angel who is tender loved, desiring that David should be an angel, desiring that humanity should be on Earth, and that what is better be attained, and that liberty be understood, that puritanicalism not be added to what is given by God, to remove from his children, that those who were tempted to that which is mutalated and strange, would turn towards that way which offers them beauty which is preserved in heaven, that there we will have new bodies, as I have read myself, that a holy people might attain holiness, and that the light of truth might be for all.


	










	


















The Second Book: The Ways of Eternal Victory
by: Lucifer

So there is the second book for things of war, and the explaination is offered, that the combat of the enemy is to be understood by some who are prepared to understand what takes place on Earth, that the places of the devil's armies are opened and his soldiers walk upon the planet, to carry out war against the kingdom, and even at times, to strengthen the cults of Earth, the kingdoms that belong to him, and not to strengthen the king of heaven, being Christ's kingdom, that he even tempted the Christ, and offered him lordship over the cults on Earth, the kingdoms, if the Christ would be under the power of the devil, and worshipping the devil and not God, giving his glory to the one who does not have the after-life, and so it seems imprudent, and yet the offer is accepted among many people groups, that they join the cults which are engaged in money and material gain and shun what is sacred and good, giving up a person's soul, their very essence of value and worth, for the pursuit of money, being a cult even, at times, that some have become part of, and yet for others they are suffering quickly when they have even dabbled in such a cult, that they are rejected quickly from that place, and even I do not know if this is because of God, and it is good. But if goodness is to be found, let it be found in God, for He is good, and as for the second book, being The Ways of Eternal Victory more truth is given, only nothing by which a person might use within the church amongst those who are beautiful, but things that are for war against the enemy, those soldiers in the armies of the devil, being ugly or becoming ugly once it is known that they were always ugly, that the Earth is shrouded in places of darkness and there is light, and the devices of the devil are amongst the people to be against God, those who are beautiful, being the Elsnon, those who are allies, being the Fen People, and the Entrith, and the Mountain Men, and the Jews, and the angel having much like of David, and understanding the three types of good and righteous who if they were removed from the Earth, the Earth would descend to hell, that the Earth is sustained because of them. For when there are no more good upon Earth, then will blood come upon their heads, and they bend, and sink into the depths of hell with the floor of the Earth, and the devil has desired to do this thing, or it seems so, for he does not profit by the victories of God, but by the murder of the innocent men have partnered with the devil, to do his will. Now if the Adam was still tending the garden what would be, and who would he be with, and who can know the will of God in this way, that a serpent of a type has deceived the woman with the words of kindness, that to eat of the apple you will be like gods and your husband with you if he eats, and so they ate, and their eyes were opened to know right from wrong, good and evil, that they perceived their nakedness in that time, and were cast from the garden, and the fiery device guarded that place turning this way and that to keep any from entering in to eat of the tree of life that was in the garden, that they had need of the tree to live forever, and without the tree they would die. Now if one has decieved for the result of death another will attempt to tell truth to deliver a person to what gives eternal life, that you will be in heaven, with spiritual bodies, after the phase is over, and the next phase, the after-life, begins.

For the other book: There are many things that are to be permitted, that though you think you know, when you know more, you are permitting it, that the one who is correcting without knowing more is sometimes resented. But then are not all such? But if any wishes to go astray is it not for God and not for people to be against? For denying freedom, when you are not stopping, is it not against God? Now you do not know the strategies of God and are not all wise as He is and capable of knowing the future as he does, and as we have been told, not even the prophets can know the future well, but know some of the future and are able to prophesy, but your wisdom is sufficient to know that to be against a person’s freedom is against them and God, so that your rebukes when they have been rejected and it is another’s freedom are then the works of war against God when you are not relenting, and God is with them who would be rebuked and is it even so far that the one who does not relent is to be outside the kingdom of heaven if they do not relent? But God is with the one who is rebuked? But this is not the same as a parent who corrects their child, the one they love, and a person has only to know who their parents are, and it is not the wise rebuke that is for the person attaining their goal. But if it is not their goal than what can any do? But you think it is so easy to be against God that a hypocracy and contradiction occurs? But I write about matters that are in the realm of war where people would attempt to attack in an ugly way, and not the rebukes and departures of society. But if it is in the realm of war then you will heed the proverb if you wish to know that this is not for society but is for it where any has entered into the realm of war, so that none of it applies and should be considered unless a person is exceeding that which is in the realm of society and they must go far for this to happen. But many things are to be permitted and you know what is acceptable, that no anti-Christ spirit be among you to wage war against the beuitiful, for a wise rebuke is beautiful and what is beautiful cannot be in error in this matter, and so who is it against? But it is against the ugly who are not with you, that they are not part of your church, and have come to be an attacking soldier, have come in their foolishness and anomicity to be soldiers who would be against God, to cause the people who are His to sin. Therefore if you are part of the church than this is not for you and does not apply to you in anything you do, because you are beautiful and you are permitted and more is right for you in the eyes of God and people on Earth. Now the anti-Christ wishes for uglieness as he is full of wickedness and against beauty, and he has self-hatred, hatred of humanity, hatred of God, hatred that informs those on his house of hell, that gives birth by a core motive of man to that which it will. For hatred is more with the levels of understand and that most shallow level than the other levels, being deeper, that absorb the bad motive and dampen its effects. But where there is no thing that will dampen, than the effects are at their greatest. Not all that is good and done will inform the motive, and if the motive is overcome it will render reward back to what is good that good will increase again as the outward work was done and good increased and the inner battle won and good increased so that beauty and the afterlife of reward is to those better at fighting, who are victorious, but those who lose become ugly, and will perish into hell. Now if any has made ugly by the ugly as they, some of them, are homicidal sicophants, violent and mutilating, than as Christ returned on the third day so they will return, either on Earth or in Heaven, that these evil beasts are horrible and wicked, as it may be understood. But in matters of war and combat when it is truly so will you be able to judge almost two or three things that a person could do when there is true war? For if the soldiers who would protect you are wicked and stubborn, being traitors to the wicked because their hearts are wicked and stubborn, than what can you do if any ugly person has thought to mutilate and utterly kill in their intense rage and hatred that is with jealousy? But if an ugly person should even be killed, and some are, because of their uglieness, and not because of what beauty they have, even then, how can any judge a beautiful person when the neutral soldiers have become stubborn traitors? But should the angels perish that when there is war before God he will have no army and those on Earth will be swallowed into hell? But has any of them believed that the devil with them will make their own afterlife? Can God be vanquished being God? So how does and angel believe they can defeat Him and his armies? But did God not create the heavens and the angels who dwell in it? Do you believe that any believed that God could be killed? But when a country is taken from an Empire by those who dwell in it than does the King die? But the Empire of a great King would have many countries. Now how does a rebellious man speak when such is said? But let him have truth if he wishes it, else he has no rebellion against God, but only against what is on Earth.
	Now if only vexation is coming from those who are openly against God, than why do you truly consider them to be your enemies when they are not causing you trouble, when they are against all things that would persecute you and others, that they are clinging hard to the core things, the freedoms that we would have, and if they are causing you some small irratation, are these really the ones who are persecuting you, if any are, and some are dwelling with much peace in what they believe. But if ever they should persecute you, than such will be a different matter, only they have lauded your free speech, and they have hated evil violence that would be against you and them, and they mock a little, but they are not attempting to stop you from pursueing your freedoms? But if any has been persecuted by these, and truly, than it should be understood that each person is different, and that the concept of tribal anarchy is not the truth, but the kingdom of heaven is the truth, and morality is for all. Now are the foolish and unintelligent to kill you and them, because they are lacking power, and so they they act in an outward way that is of a person who is not secure in what they believe, not believing it well enough for themselves, that they over-compensate, or not believing themselves secure enough, that they act out with violence, and are they to travel to places where you are and kill you, being interloping meddlers when they act, and not regarding the foolishness of it, that it is pointless violence, and seeks attention for themselves, when it is pointless, because they were for being ignored again, and they could not be at peace, to be ignored. Now the atheists are not promoting this, and they speak against it, and you believe them to be your enemies? But if they rib you, if they mock a little, is this so unbearable? But you are secure in what you have, and presently more powerful in what is controlled, and they are only for removing any religion from science, and religion is for removing science from religion, and so is it not fair and right what they do? But do not be as if zelous people of the Old Testiment when it is not Israel being commanded by God, because in these matters, God has told you to love your neighbour as yourself and to do to others as you would have them do to you. But those who are truly against you are not doing pety things to annoy you, but are killing many and attacking them with violence and many methods that are true war.

But do not say it will injure, because it will not, and do not say it is evil, because most have understood it correctly, that those who understand less not cause problems, but it is already so, and always will be, when a person hears words from others about what is wrong, when there is no wrong, that if a person has not done evil yet, than it is so that there is no evil yet, but those who pull another away, or intervene from prudence, perceiving the heart, are not being simple, but are of the wise. Now the brother of him was not being evil, and most understood, and there was no trouble, but there went out from one a person who did not understand and placed his lack of understanding before many, and many of them did not know what he was doing. But so it is in many ways among my own people, that they have been taught the lack of understanding of others, who cannot be with those who understand, who wrestle with friends, and are with love for their brothers, and so there are a multitude of such things that have been placed before many because of the lack of understanding of another, and in many places, so that it would be better for some if they had never been to this place, but let them not be gathering the lack of understanding of others, but considering carefully, when they are gathering in such a way.

Now do you not know you are not of this world but are of the kingdom of God that has the afterlife and is known to them who are in it. For besides those who would slay you, there are other people groups that were not stated and some of these are difficult for you to understand. Now the entrath are a people who do more of what they are called that they cannot abide being called any mean name, being not acceptable as it is most times for you of the kingdom, and the Entrath are a sensative people who when a person speaks good of them, they are for being good to them. But to call a Entrath a name begins war often with them, and yet they are not often for violence but are for peace. Therefore if an Entrath is in fighting with you speak well of them to those they are judged by that an Entrath might be good to you and want peace. Now are the Entrath not actually a kind folk? But their kindness is with them and their mercy towards humanity, only they are a sensative folk and in gentleness and strength in what they must do. Why will you offend them? But be defending yourself and always standing up for yourself knowing that they are also not to be damaged, for will you maul a bird because it pecks you while you interact with it? So is my advice on the Entrath. Now what are the wolves and are any good? But there are wolves who are for you and those against you and those who are peaceful with the beautiful are not some of them beloved? But what is on Earth is always in two races. Those of heaven and those of hell. Now the Elves are the kingdom and it is understood that those of the church where I reside must be Elves. Now I jest, because I do not call them Elves but refer to a story which is loved because the truth that is real is in their hidden hearts and because of some closer proximity and because they are God’s or meant to be, they like this story. But the beautiful people are immortal being in the way of life and having eternal life and the ugly have already perished and perish again. Now what is the case of those who have been told they must perform something and it becomes like a wrong meddling for them in another people group and they are having an unwellness in the eyes of God because of it, and a sickness in his house, like a child who has gone out one day and eaten berries that were not permitted, so that they would then be in a safe place when they are able and if His son is a physician than is the Lord not capable. But I know that when God wills it He is casting an Island into the Ocean and that we are not God and we are not a law of righteousness but are seeking to obey him and having no law, so that He is in control and the truth has power over the Universe.

Now the one who might commit wrong for another, breaking the laws of man, are like the soldiers on Earth and it is done for God, because the soldiers should have performed it and a life must be saved. Now is this one scorned by the righteous? But is it not those of the enemy who are among you who might scorn it? But a friend has been deceived by lies shown and told that they might have wrath when they will understand? But the enemies are in the realm of war and will not accept justice and neither will the soldiers who are traitors. But the soldiers do this thing when it is right and when they must be loyal but they are good will you truly resent them and be against all of them, those who are not traitors? But it is not even good to use profane speech before such soldiers and will you be turning against God when the time has come to return to peace? But always know that not all were traitors and that they too are endangered by those who are wicked that they may have fought far more than you for what is right. Now will you wish them all death? But when there is then peace and a return to peace than more will be gathered to be worshiping God.

Now people who are comparible to a type of creature on the planet are not animals, of course, and this known. But when they are comparible to a creature and people of the kingdom or human but not people of the kingdom this is what was only assumed. Now do you think that when a race is mentioned they are actually some creature and not a race? But if you believe I do not know that you are free, and also from me, because I do not attempt to defend what I offer, only I would not want confusion. But does any think a thing prior mentioned is another thing or that two things that are different are the same? But would this not be very unjust and towards what is good and God’s because it is something I have not told you about and you think it is something that it is not? But when Adam was in the garden the Lord brought to him every creature and if he can tell the difference to name that which he has not been told of than his children, too, can do this thing, so you not be made disabled by what you might have assumed and do what is not just, for I do not give you all wisdom and knowledge of the Universe.

Now it is good that any should want the Christ to return while they have not carried out their years in this phase and those watching do not do so in a pointless way because it is with faith in what is true. Now if heaven is to be granted on Earth where a New Jerusalem will be do they not desire to be citizens? But there is one even better than some angels in this way and do you not know that He even finds fault in the angels? But if you are desiring some cult that is in the world, being some kingdom, than if it is belonging to the devil and those who follow him are going towards hell, is it then wise to be exhaulting yourself and what wrong kingdom you are in? But I would prefer that people be in the kingdom of heaven, that they be truly prudent in this phase.

Because not understanding he spoke already in ignorance words not able to be used for peace, and one who was not understanding even took action that he might do violence. Now one considers and it is private for them and they cannot be judged but those who act before they understand are not to be considered of no fault because they did not understand.

Now are the commands meant for war or for peace? But if you do not fail at this you might recognize the ability to judge at a small level.

Now if there black people who are sensative are they not also sensative for you? But the one who is considering serious things and treating them as if serious, are they not to be favoured for this, when their wisdom is shown in the time when it is shown? But if you are guarding your sisters because of this consideration that is the physical ethnicity than will you consider yourselves to be knowing what the one who is not doing so is? For this discord is becoming ugly in small ways and perceived by the wise who are with those doing well. But can this evil be with you if you are people of the kingdom? Indeed it shows that some have not understood and a place is having division and yet no great evil that they would discuss it because you do not consider the wise, because you do not regard the better standard. For you are for gaining wisdom and yet do not regard it when there is a matter for the wise? But only when such is defiled by wicked criticisms is there anything wrong in it. But know that injustice is understood and that the wise women of Egypt were fearing God even so far as to risk their lives and this is not also true of the Egyptian men? But indeed it is true and it is not the physical ethnicity you ever deal with in problems but only what is true in the eyes of God.

Now if one group is against you will they cut you off from your allies? But if one group is against you than are the others of a same name, though they are not the same? But in war one tribe puts another against their allies, and one tribe uses another tribe’s flag when they attack that war be placed against a person’s allies that they are both being destroyed. Now the anti-Christ’s have a heart for seeking out these strategies of war, and they have known them more often than you who are beautiful and for peace. Now those who are beautiful must learn to wield a sword and must be skilled with the bow and manners of defence and wisdom, to be learning the skills of wisdom in these matters and becoming that which is of great ability, that you will learn the value of defending your people when one of you should be under attack, that you will know the jelous one who cannot compete for themselves and thus attempts to sow discord by using another who is not your enemy, and you will know the foolishness and calamity of mind of the one who attacks you, even accusing you for defending yourself when they trespassed in a fashion and attacked. For an ugly person has sought to be a parent or older brother from a scowl of hatred on their face that their grotesque ways are ugly and perversions of justice, judgement, and good things that are not defiled, are defiled by them because of their raging hearts of hatred. Now I write about Sodomites and not those who would be men with men in terms of their preference, because it must be stated due to a contention that became low in recent history, when people began to use the bible for their disagreance. Now men who are with men in matters of sexuality are not unrighteous unless they are for other reasons and yet they are commuting what is called sexual immorality in which they are abusing themselves, a temple, and yet have not many of you abused yourselves and you are judging this smaller thing as if it was a very great thing? But do not separate yourself from allies, and selfishly so, for it also seeks to seperate them from God, and this is a great evil, but it seperates them from you, and the kingdom has no use for division when the soldiers of the devil are on the land.    —Now if the devil is believing in mutilation and defiling what is sacred that he might bring Earth to hell when all the good and righteous have been slayn represented by only a few who account for all who are pleasing God and keeping the Earth from descending to hell, than how great a victory would consider it in battle to do this thing he would attempt? But I am not knowing God’s will, because the disciples were slayn and many of the saints of the kingdom of heaven, and this to profit for them and God, and so I have said, what do I know, and how far is wisdom from me and how much, but to know it is always beyond great what I have not known and understood, so that I would return to the Christ, but I grow angry because He has not given another message to me, not by words, so that I have been upset not to be in heaven, and then there is no hatred of any person who is good to me, who I love, for Isaac lost his mother and was comforted by her who he loved, and then I would seek to understand the war and how this profits, that where one dies more are brought onto the Earth, that the tree has perished and there are more trees from it, but I am understanding that wisdom is a defence and that those who are to live by righteosness are then knowing the season in which it is their time to die that the enemy might not say that it is always your time that because of your foolishness you should not live, but die, for such hatred and mocking is in the mouth of their heart. Now if the kingdom is His than the saints are to remain in it, that the wisdom of defence does not instruct offensive war, only the dead are dying and those living are profiting in their death for God and them. Now if you have the kingdom you are understanding the concept of the next life for which you prepare, that a man does not abandon a woman who should not be abandoned, that fools have given commands against what is more pleasing to God. 

Now some are already in heaven with God and they are here on Earth, but their hearts are in heaven, and will it be that this will be hated by some? For the soul of a person is perceiving what they cannot, that they might drive a person to where they belong, because they are busy about the task and the person is a problem for them. 

Now can God be in two places to be with those who obey and those who go against His will? But if they do not believe than have they made themselves the Shepard of the people who did not wish for them to do so? But this is not known to the people and the Shepard is losing track of when his flock was there that he came from a foreign land to find a flock that was not his.

When you are residing in a country in which men are not with righteousness, but if they are departing from their righteousness because of jelousy, than those reside their are not safe in the land and must be among those of the kingdom because the land has no faithful righteousness and thd righteousness is an allusion. Now if there is even another thing and that is the worst offendors are at war with the righteous to attack their finances and being angry as one who has wrath at rebuke and would kill those who rebuke them in that moment and they are clinging to their wrath when they are rebuked, to carry out vengence because they believe another should die and they are greatly with wrath because the insecurity of their guilt has made their wrath great, than they are attacking with corruption and those corrupt people in government jobs that they know and others know, so that the land is like a land that is in a state of civil war, and how will any say that they are safe.

The core motives of a person are jelousy, guilt being a lacking, love, righteousness, goodness. Now if any person is lacking they are reliant upon what is not bad and not upon what is bad that guilt does not bring forth foolishness which end, if it is a measure of guilt great enough, is actually death when the actions from the guilt have been fulfilled that the confession is from bad actions that are offensive.

The one who does wickedness in lies, slander, tale-bearing, and such things, and is being as if righteous is not a Jew. So if the Gentiles know it, than why does any speak against Moses?

The one who cannot change is so by more substance than you, that being in a weak place, like one interloping on the land of a kingdom, and you a wandering citizen with a family in the desert, so there is no military by which you commit any injustice, that you not make the fashion in which you have been deceived into great wickedness, that you lose your inheritance and you are the child to be cast out, that you are failing in your allusion of what never was, that it cannot hold you, that you become a servant to the sons and daughters and your family servants to them if they support you in this thing, because God is judging rightly and is not a fool and we have been made by Him and cannot fail to perceive what is the real truth, that the folly of any, even should it exist, holds no truth when man might seek to place it there, and so when it is not even there, what sympathy is there for you?

There is great weight and serious judgement place on one matter by God and you do not much regard it? There is less weight and judgement on another matter by God, and you place great judgement on it? But if you are not a Jew or Gentile than what are you that you do not perceive right and wrong? But an unjust fool with little understanding, Luke-warm and thus the least, to be cast into the place that is away. 

Now the multitudes kept coming to Jesus, and He was the Christ, so that he became exhausted and went to the boat that He might have rest and the angel thought of Him, you are greater than I, and will I, too, have need of being saved by you who commands me and gives me what I have, that my power is yours and with it I would defend you, because I am at times not capable of defending myself. So as they came to you more in their goodness they are good and I am not able to perform to a level to meet such good and so let it be that goodness will continue and the angel will be known for what he is and not more, but does any expect the angel to take anything like that which would belong to a messiah to bear? For there is a greater ability but do they claim more is there because of it? But there have been some who have come to greatness by their sacrifices and suffering for God. Now for these I will yield a little because their words are with true substance of deeds that belong to God, and how will I contend if I should attempt to go over the limit to do injustice?

Now do some not hate soldiers because women like them, and so their rage and hatred is great, that they become wicked, and what is like-woman and not acceptable for men, that they have reviled them as bullies, evil killers, and they have commited many acts of valour? For not even half of what some have done is reported, and perhaps for the better. But people of great ability have travelled and landed in places where there is no reasoning but that commited with knives and rifles and in their own country there are like-women men who have not had cause to hate them as when there is a reason but have despised them in their heart that they might escalate to homicidal rage that actions might be carried out? But I think you know what should be done with these if they act.

Now there is the spirit which brings deceit to a person to believe that which is not true and it must be separated from the spirit of wisdom because it will kill those who it is in if they do not remove it. For as long as your body is still alive it is not too late. For the spirit is in the mouths of people to add to the spirit and yet the young child does not have it, for it is only taking refuge in those older. Now I am for speaking about that which some have come to believe is true and is a lie because of those things that are not real and are with the spirit that deceives. But can any of understanding who are not in the kingdom cast it out even if they have been told about it? But you did not always have these deceptions but the spirit of wisdom should remain. For men have been placed in prison since the beginning and for doing the right thing and those who keep it are sometimes wicked and stubborn. Have not soldiers been taken to prison when there is not war but they are in their own nation and traitors are there? But thousands of years of billions of people have gone into prisons and out of them and did not the Apostle boast about it, because he had been to prison more than the others? But do not be scorned or bothered when the shallow cult of the world would scorn you with their doctrine which they incur loss in for what is better, and are denied all because it, those things that all the heros of the Old and New Testiment had. 

If you would betray one do not steal from them, but the enemy is known for what they are, that they were not loyal before.

Now they go a different way to Heaven and are already there in heart, and so I was to give them swords and bows but they take another way, these who are persecuted, and so these are not angels but they are the saints, and I am fighting to protect them but they are turning the other cheek and I am then alone? But though I am comforted like Isaac was after his parents were gone I am not perceived to be alone because of those of the church that is containing some of the saints who would be given the name David would give or the angel but I do not give the name God gives, unless by some chance, it is the same. Now they are the Elsnon who are beautiful and immortal who are in the phase before the after-life, and they are allies of all who are pleasing God, the other peoples who are wise and righteous.

Now who is this holy woman that I have perceived? But what is she with and what tribe? But she is doing well, pleasing, and she is scattering away what would encroach against what is good.

Now what of the other churches and can I name them? But we will call them a good name that is acceptable to them until they give us their name. Now the Fen people who are wise, who are a mystery to the understanding of the Elsnon and are being good to us? But what can we know of them for who can search anything about them or desire to, for they are being holy? But these are dwelling in deep waters and wisdom, keeping that which we do not know. Now they are seeming to be what is good, and are they not to dwell among us if it pleases them? But what other races are there, and what are they in the churches? For those men of the wilderness, being another race, are more capable than any, crafty and yet still in righteousness, men who have much understanding, for it is them doing wisdom in which they seem to differ from us in what they do. Now they are showing themselves capable of accomplishing and are able to do those things in skill that they carry out with greater ability that leaves one in awe like as if an elite group of warriors in battle who leave one in awe with their ability. So less of these is needed to accomplish even more and better, that there is greatness in their wise skill and greatness in their people, and some of them are warriors. Now what have those in the cults of the devil claimed about all who please God and have wisdom, in the ways they exhault themselves, being the poor who exhaults himself in a base and low way and not him or her who is holy, who are like angels. But those in the kingdoms of the devil are in poor kingdoms and they have riches but do not perceive what they are in truth, being blinded by the disease of  their cults. Now if they have reviled any people it is pointless and nothing. But God has given the truth to those who would have it, and who I do not know, or why, because this is not understood by me. Now if any of the cults of the devil should seek to exhault themselves by speaking badly about you, even to denigrate, their words are as pointless as nothing, for most of them are even in great ignorance about what they are. Now as they exhault all that is material and not given by God, they are exhaulting themselves and their cult which is the devils. Now to be thrown into a lake of fire and to do that which results in this is not wise. Nor is it wise to revile God in envy of those who are pleasing God. But when they laugh, is it with arragance that their strength would increase against you? For the truth that is God’s they do not desire but they would rather have their lies and the mixture of the devil’s cults that they attend the places of religion but are having no part in it because what is in them is pulling them back to the cults of the devil.

Now when one is not well do we punish their unwellness? But we wait until they are well, and we are patient with the sick. But who hears of a great evil and it having nothing to do with the child because their behaviour is a different matter, and the person not being the parent is judging the child with great iniquity and condemnation, as if a blood-thirsty person who wishes to murder when they judge? But who then is a judge among you that the ways peace, that what is beautiful might not be tempted to become what is more ugly? But the patience of some is far exceeding that of others and caring for the sick is not for all but then there is no fool who believes they are having to care for the sick when they are not, if any should wish to speak blasphamy to what I have written and profane what I have given. For if they even profane the legislator of a nation and blaspheme it, than why are they thinking they do not commit that which is less beautiful when they revile those even who are good and curse those who are not part of their groups? But evil must come and when there is cause, will you then say it is evil? But the Pharisees, too, are for attacking the beautiful.

Now the one being poor is not praising themselves and exhaulting themselves like a wicked man who boasts and speaks wickedness and is poor, and this you have already understand in a hard and inescapable way that you did not fail to understand. Now did the Jews deceive you or you wicked heart to speak injustice in such a way. But the son of the better man who might be despised though he is worthy to have a servant is possessing that which is of kings and queens. Now you blaspheme and profane when you use the scripture in a wicked way.

Now there is one who wants to ensure that the cults of the devil are kept out for safety that the church might not be corrupted and those in it, and there is another who wishes that some would repent in the manner Christ taught and then choose the church which is having those who are beautiful that they might proselytize and both are in agreance. Now an ugly person cannot be in such a church when they are ugly before God, and and ugly person cannot remain if they are going in the ways of what is ugly in a consistent way, and they have not been mistreated, not even by poison, and they are not sick in some fashion, being unwell. So you will release them from you, you will formally and respectfully ask them to leave, and you will not shame unless it is a case where they must be removed by force. But you will not shame them in the presence of others to be ugly yourself, but if it can be done with respect it will be, that you not be ugly in your behaviour towards them when they are not to be among the church anymore. But another church will be for them.

Now there is that other cult that comes from another and both belong to the devil, and it is taking those who are not rich that they might disregard objective thinking and truth to denegrate others who attempt to make positive change in an objective fashion and not with bias, so that they are mocking and degrading reason and objective truth in their arragance that is like distracting foolishness while some attempt to do what is good. Now what cult is above this, that communes more closely with the devil? But these will be persecuting you when they have acquired more strength and if it should not come than I would be grateful for the peace. But if it is too much to bear to be jelous for any of your enemies that their jelousy turns to envy and extends beyond the reach of a Jew, and I offer a compliment to them, that their sight would extend so far as to be resentful and bitter towards the church where there are beautiful people, that they nurture in them hatred because of all they lost in becoming part of a cult of the devil, than you will know that the devil is for doing war against the beautiful and some of you will be prepared for the day that you are to be wise as the serpents and in strategy that has victory being the one who does not offend that allies will know that they, too, are beautiful who are supporting you. So those who are pleasing to God will force out the ugly from encroaching and waging war against you.

Now the one who hopes you are not permitted to do something when it is regarding a parent is being a mocking and wicked servant, but it is not like one in other places when the person is a citizen. Now what do they assume of you? But are they to be mocking or acting the part of a wicked fool? But no child is speaking this way and they have lowered the moral standard so far that demons and those like them are being called children as if it was spiritual, and they are not children. Now this is one strategy and you will know what is right and that you remember not to be destroyed by the consequence of commiting crimes, but if anyone should commit crimes with your flag and attempt to frame you than they are indeed those who commited the crime and the other crime that sought to slander others. Now if any wishes to slander you to portray you as an evil than you are offering truth and you do not have to be ashamed by what has been shown or claimed because you are capable of delivering the truth that the church not be destroyed by the slander of the devil. For if they claim you have offended children, and this is the most common slander, than as you are utterly against such actions, you will know how ignorant and disgusting they are, like base men who mock the holy places. For there are ugly people behind it and is it not like one ugly person who attempts to throw mud upon what is beautiful with their words because their hands are angry to do violence and restrained, or is it not like one who sexually harasses the young virgin in her beauty because they desire to do violence? But it is an attack on all beautiful people, even those not part of your church. Let the ugly be cast into hell.

Now the who is accused of something when they have been in contention is not be degraded but not accountable, and it is not like one who is called names when the contention is over. Now if any is harassing one with sexual harrassment than they are angry and their hands are angry and seized by violence, although they do not place their hands on any.  Now what manner of anger is this and what was done by another that it came? Do not fail to uphold one who might be in the right when it is not yet known if they commited some great offence against another. But as you uphold women you also uphold men before all is known. You do not act as if you do not believe what they say or you exploit conflict to do evil, and who enters a place of a funeral to harass a widow? But a fool will not be given responsibility if he is saying that what is serious and to be judged or hated is not wrong and is nothing. But such is not yet wise enough for the task. But a person being questioned who is good is like an Entrath when something has happened. Those who have ears to hear let them listen.

But if any man is married to a Elsnon and is not an Elsnon himself, he is to be welcome, and the woman who marries a man who is an Elsnon becomes an Elsnon because of the marriage.

Now heaven is with you and you will be there into the next phase, the afterlife, upon death, but it is not good to be commiting suicide for the sake of beauty for the beauty will be preserved in heaven.

Now a man said to me that if you are not in pain you should be happy, and so if any is in pain because another lives than the wise should be taking such matters seriously, that a disposable fool not be permitted to do that which a young fool who is not human would do to one who is beautiful, and they are an adult? But the perverse by wickedness are of no worth. Indeed they attack the worth of others, and though others are gathered like him they only mock and stand against you in shame and guilt though they are clothed in insolence and confidence to debate what they should have much wrath against as you.

Now what is of David, that you might remember, that those who would be rovving to commit crimes against others for reward or promotion are evil parasites and villains that he even killed them who did such when there was war, and would Joab speak differently? But Joab chose David, and a great and brilliant general, who possessed what wisdom he possessed who is considered to have excellent understanding. Therefore I would listen to David’s judgement in this matter. For some servants have even been  sent from the king, even king David from the throne, to give encouragement to a soldier of great ability and the servant, being wicked, was exceedingly disrespectful and his hands sought to assissinate an excellent warrior who had fought for David, and what was David’s judgement. For he even killed those who killed his enemies in battle who were rovving and seeking rewards from kings. But the servant being wicked and acting as if on behalf of David was not to be killed? But David rode out early to kill evil-doers and he cut and killed those who did cruelty in the land in their pride to swallow the holy, the noble, the poor who are holy, who would in their cruelty speak cruelty of the needy and do evil, and the Lord favoured him more than Solomon whom I have read, but do I know his son? But his words only I have known, and the wisdom of the Christ I have sought for myself. Now I have known that it is not good for oneself to be with a prostitute, but she is a prostitute no more than than I offer no guidance because she is not a prostitute any longer. But do you not know that Jews are given this guidance? Now when you are at war are you to be having any love, truly? But those who have not known such things are better to indulge such an idea that David was wise. Now if I have seen him in my own eyes and that if it is his house, is it not from God if you are to be considering the things of heaven? But jewals are to be placed in the heaven by one, and by what means I do not know, only the Christ is not proud to attack His own house. But fulfill all and it is so that he utterly attacked to kill every philistine and with his sword, his shield, giving gain to Israel and gain to the Christ. Now if his spear is God’s, and not his sword than how will I perceive the meaning? But let him only know that the new Satan and the one who is Lucifer is not the old who is still existing, and that he wishes the blessing and good will from David. Now what is to occur prior that I will know of later if such can be done? But if Adam has not eaten and remains that, what is he to be? But is God returning anything to the Adam who is in the garden to work there and have the fruit and to be without his wife? But is it to be known in heaven that an angel came from one like Job? For wives and honour he had and many gifts from God that the Lord showered him with every gift that is good and he kept all evil from him and increased him greatly and he rebelled in love against God, only in words, that he might throw off the one who would contend who might hate God, and was he given more than any who ever lived, even something like paradise when God had kept his enemies away from him, spread his wings over him to shelter him, giving him wives and permitting women who were not wives, and as that man was even seeking wisdom, the Lord gave him wisdom, and as that man sought what is good, he was found in obedience to God, and it was easy, for the Lord sheltered him much, so that not so suddenly all disappeared from him and he found himself in a desert where he was shallow of heart and empty in heart and he felt abandoned and he was to be taken through that land like Isaiah and he was to even be close to people of Sodom and he was to be receiving from God, for as much as he had every luxury prior by God, he was to endure what it was to be a wandering traveller without his prior riches that God had provided. Now where is the upright prophet? But a false prophet is known because he speaks about others and there are things that are not true and he does not speak in general statements as if one who has gathered information. But if the devil has attacked is it so that God might have some cause to save me? But if I leave any alive who I have been commanded to wipe out than is it so they will gather later to attack the nation? But I offer it to the Christ and He gives me blood and bread, and I am in the place where, and what it is, Satan, that if I speak some holy tongue then by wisdom they might know, and if they are abandoning the kingdoms of the devil, than how much more are their hearts giving treasure to heaven. But if a sick person does that which is disturbing do they have a demon or is their heart and mind seized by iniquity? But why is the iniquitous one attempting to cause iniquity in others? Now if they have caused so much sin by force in others than how much greater and more was their sin? But do you think it has not to increase with doing wickedness. For wickedness is even bringing forth perversities and the one who is evil as a sane man is then evil as an insane man, but God has desired that all should be well of this thing. Now if any ignorant person is blaspheming and profaning what was meant for good and wellness in this way than in truth it is blasphamy against what is sacred, being what God desires of all and a person who is not to be touched with it in truth. For an ignorant man has sputtered out brute ignorance and the one whose wisdom is better has sought to speak good. Now is one rich in the things of the devil more rich than one who conceals much of value? But those who are not one of the people are not Jews in the religion, but God is capable of restoring them to Israel.

But if a terrorist thinks themselves a soldier or even a freedom fighter than they are against the soldiers and freedom fighters and they are not having the substance of men, whether men or women, that their voices might be heard like that of the wise woman’s who comes into the places of kings and queens where there are councillors, being permitted there. But if a terrorist is thinking themselves worthy to be a freedom fighter and they are not all men, both the men and women, than they are like a group of feeble-minded fools who are in confusion, and they are known by their mouths that they are not men. But if those of great ability being far more capable than men are to come upon them, than is it not a massacre and yet they have been killed by soldiers? But in recklessness and foolishness they waged attack and those who attack civilians have the advantage that they are more like those who break into houses to kill with guns that they are like them who plant bombs and do not reveal themselves. So if shoulders of great power are to slay them than how much substance did they have except it was the substance of those they attacked that those with nothing attacked those who possessed much more. Now does any man or woman in business give reward to thieves when they are attempting to steal saying the payment, the watering and the giving of resources will go to you who are a thief and squanders other’s work, who does not gain and produce good for themselves and others but goes from place to place to take what is not theirs as if all was pointless. For no justice can be commited with wickedness if there is not a contradiction, and no revenge can exist because of justice because what exceeds justice is not justice any longer. But in such a place as this there are theives who will steal what can be of no value to them, being like those who are rovving and commiting crimes in the hope they will be rewarded by kings or queens for what they do and what they steal. For there is riches and poverty both in this place and many of the best ones have been cast out to the streets and it is to be in the city as it is in Heaven. But to what I compare it? The good were cast out when the war began on God’s people, and the daughter is alone and with fear that she does not deserve because the wicked are all about to die of old age who did wrong. Now how is it to be said that a place is evil that is not so, but the wicked here are suicidal in what they do, and who is there to stop them if the soldiers are practising desperate measures and casting out offendors? For many are cast out by the wicked and some who offend are cast out by soldiers who are capable of knowing when a person is not to be cast out, so that some judgement is too harsh. But if one is for giving water and food and another for fighting what will any do but pray for the king of the place? Now the king or queen I have not known and they are over the city and are with those who desire that more wealth be given to the poor. Now I was spared from any hardship of the street and have always be and yet I have been in the land of Isaiah which is there, to be amongst those I did not sleep with, the women of that place. I have not betrayed any who did good to me and do not indulge discord, for wisdom must be had to know, that what belongs to God is His to have, only no great wrong was commited before my eyes. Now if the young are upon the streets and doing what they can than what is required for them first is shelter and money before they can properly indulge in more, and is this not understood? But in truth one requires a cigarette and no unsympathetic and evil critic, and money for food and money for shelter and money for other things. Now there are strong fools living in better places than these, and they are for contending with those better behaved than them, that strong fools have sought to punish when the grand-parents departed, because of the great love for the children’s children that they were not with their fathers. Now should it not be so that the child should be taken back because there is no shame? But do not do to any what provoked stubbornness where matters of parents and children are concerned because if the parent loves the child they are the parent. But if you consider casting any out because they are not tame than is it not because of God and you that they are not tame? But a parent is capable of loving all their children and the one causing contention with the parent is sometimes being swallowed by their love that you do not be casting out because of the things of God because the father is not there. But there are those who harden their hearts against their child because the child is with the rich and poor and not with the middle of money, and they are as if stolen from the family like stolen bread and water that does not turn bitter but will be exceeding. So another, and not I, has stolen her, and so he is and yet he is not, like a picture that appears and then disappears. Like a picture appearing in water to disappear or in a mirror to disappear. For the leaves have been shed upon the grass and the day is sprinkled with dew that the wind gusts and there is a time and place to be opened by another.

The wicked contradict themselves but a righteous man is not speaking hypicracy.

Now for the Jews and Gentiles, if they have attacked and you told others in some way or did something that they cannot attack will they then attack in another way so that it is not within your ability to receive help, so that it becomes difficult to make a complaint? But such is an adjustment of war against you and there are those who forbid to do what is right in their invented puritanicalism. For they forbid to eat meat and they are promoting only herbs because they are poor and envious and they are angry at God, who they may not even know of, to war against Him. 

Now if a person who is understood to be for justice is picking and choosing in what his heart desires that is not complying with objective truth and justice than it is an unjust judge who does not regard God or men, except he regards God in the matter of his being killed by men, and the woman who is this, regards God and men in the matter of her being killed by any, that she then considers herself to be a woman. But when it is not so, a woman who judges must take upon her objective truth and justice being a true quality of a man, that she is a man, but yet a woman. The one who understands finds no contradiction for the qualities are those that can be with men and women. But if the qualities of a true man are objective truth and justice than these are also the qualities of a good woman and with truth she perceives the truth about herself and men that she is seen before God, a father’s daughter before God, if she will judge in this fashion and a mother’s daughter can also but she is not often the alpha among a larger gathering of women. Now the alpha is for keeping order in what is good and she is close to God, but she will not be put away by her husband unless there is justice that will come and God save her, only she will correct me in that she is to do what is right and it is so.

To believe there is a war is to be a fool, and even more so if the matter is against one who is prettier when there is no war, not being a thing between a woman and a woman. Now a woman is capable of saving themselves from foolish women who are chaotic in jelousy and what are deceits for them that they have that would bring about chaos because of other things in them that are not good, that these things are made an open calamity for them before others. So wisdom saves a woman, and a woman strong in wisdom cannot be denied in truth that she should be with the one she chooses because she is faithful, and so she should be with the one she wants. Now a man who complains as if there was war is him who complains when he does not believe it, for in truth only small children are indulging it, and not much, when they are male. Now a woman who is degrading men is filled with hate and jelousy and if she degrades a man who is pretty she also is degrading herself. But if any man should speak so violently it is because of anger and violence in them, that the hand trembles to injure and kill and the minds of them are for blood-shed and the killing of citizens in war and soldiers in battle that these are not worthy of society and cannot remain in it in truth, and likewise for the woman who does it.

Now for every person there are different kinds, that being for everything for which there can be a good or bad, and so why will one defend another who is bad when the complaint was not for them but for the one who is good? But people are capable of knowing the difference and being for what is good as is assumed when they do not possess the same trait they are exercising ability that you are forbidden to forbid, because good is not forbidden to them when they are with truth and what is right. But the removal of words does not profit and attempts to solve a problem the wrong way and it inhibits a person from performing good. Now a person being against God is then being against themselves. But you know what is acceptable.

One has said it is over nothing when they do not understand, but a person must be capable of understanding to judge a matter. But do not be so hasty to judge justice when you do not know all things. For some are to be saved by justice and will you save them if another does not? For if you stand against judgement you in judgement that you fight against that which is a defence and you then understand that if you do not know sometimes it is right that you consider if you are able to understand. For there is the wicked who takes a long journey around the truth that they are confessing in the belief that they are with others, that their righteousness is judged by men and not God, but many men have conformed to God and not to what they speak in injustice. Now some believing themselves to be righteous are counting the known criminal to be bad in the way of wickedness that they have not considered that the criminal in the matter is more righteous than them.

No person is capable of being convinced by bullying and the one who believes it is like one is ignorant to all reality. For when one is guilty of that which is below the judgement of God than no amount of wickedness is enough for them to make themselves safe and secure, that though they seek out the worst prison for themselves where only their type of criminals are they are not finding enough wickedness for them, that the attempt is pointless to hide from the sky, to be hiding from God, and the mountains do not cover them to relief.

There is the person, and they are many who being educated have an entirely new vocabulary to describe and are just as much a fool and immoral person as they were before, and then sometimes they have become much worse because of it, being more foolish and more immoral.

An adult has become more wicked as he gives himself permissions and this is not always the cause for to remember right and wrong must be grasped by those who would grow better. For the righteous are becoming better and better and the evil becoming worse, and those attaining eternal life are those who are keeping faith and watch through the trials and tribulations, and so may I, too, remember.

But has any sent a messenger before me that this was to be the manner that he perceived much and communicated as was available to him. For prior to the Christ there were many who were producing truth that it is beginning to come through from the hands of them who might have communed in some manner with God, that it built to the messenger to prepare the way so that what was before is then yielding for the next to come, and the one after me is the Christ who died for your sins and is returning. Now if the angel is to come what will you expect of him? But I do not think you expect the Christ. Now the one prior to me was perceiving true things and writing them in with fiction and some of the things he wrote of were correct that the good have liked what is in closer proximity to the truth. But there is one to goes into small calamity and it is as if they cannot understand the meaning of what I write or that I state it might not be in any way known to him who would perceive some of the truth for he is using the Bible and so then is he, by his influences, to be an unwilling messenger to prepare the way because of what he took from his influences? But if God has said it, I will listen. For the Bible came before him and not he before the bible and if this is the truth I will believe it. But if there is prophecy that is more than I will believe God, and I will believe it when I have known that it is God who has said it. But the angel being on Earth has not known all, and if Christ came to Earth, and Elijah by woman as well, than you will expect that neither knew all? But there are some who have read the scriptures more than others. But I do not have a demon. Now I am wanting Christ’s words that are for me, because it is pleasing to me to have this, and why should I feel any remorse for not putting others before me in this way, because it would be his will. But I am not a Shepard to any of you for I cannot fulfill it. But you are a comfort to me and aid me on Earth with your good. Now I would direct you to the Christ and tell you it is not with understanding that any would worship the angel.

Now to attack the sick is not the same as being in contention with a person on the road, but the way they deny understanding is in some cases deceiving even themselves.

Now what personal notes are to be available are for scholars who are upright and of the better quality who are not being low and foolish as it has been in some cases, and the notes can be to prove that the angel does not know all on Earth as Elijah did not know all and the Christ, who commands me, that the scholars are free, only I have not considered any scholar who would wish to appeal to some by being foolish. So I write to the scholars that have considered me to let them understand that what comes to the point of extraordinairy beyond what some can contain is not contained when they have not understood, because some minds are open due to their greater understanding that they do not reject anything prior to considering it in an open-minded and serious fashion. As for those who dismiss with low remarks as if using a hand gesture or some joke, they are not worth the time for any person, honestly. For those people are making those types of jokes and remarks about everything and then another joke will come to dismiss. But what seems too much for some is not to much for others because they understand and the same is true in academia where we would not tolerate such low dismissals, but in places it has occurred. Now I would rather they claim I was crazy than they claim I was a scoundrel, and I have no problem being perceived as crazy.

Those evil will find an arguement for that which could have only been stories for truth for them are to be the lies of Jews who are persecuting people, as if the book was for the Gentiles, but some are believing in God, and are not interested in giving commands that are spontaneous because we all know right and wrong without the Bible. But if some upon reading found error in themselves and were of a strong will to not repent than no book will stand in their way, but rebuke from others without the Bible is still for them due to what people have in the knowledge of right and wrong.

A fool has attempted to cast the citizen born in the country out of the country and the fool is the terrorist and the one they would cast out a most privileged citizen who is of the majority, and this is seeming like person who is not well, even confusing, though they do not think they are alienated from society and reality.

Now not being forbidden to harass each other, are you not free to bully and harass each other? But if you are able to bully and harass even using sexual harrassment where you cannot be fired, than are you not being two people who are alone? But if you are married to an animal who is only restrained by the consequence of crime than do you think it good for you to stay with the person as if you were married to one who can be with you? But if one is not ready to leave child-good can they be married when they are not yet 14 years of age? But I do not write about actual age. But does even a child do what the one you are with does? But if you are willing to continue, than what can be done, but if you are departing, than you will not do what keeps you from gaining when you have departed, but if you are for divorce than you will be remaining married until there is divorce, that you be attaining what is good again. Now if you will incline to wisdom than it is for you, and if you will be seeking it, be seeking it early, that the busyness of a matter does not make it so you commit error when the time has come to exercise wisdom. But I know that God is greater than I, and if I am with love than how much more is He? And yet how does he judge and by what standard does he forgive? For I only give wisdom to be as guidance for those who choose it.

In our language do we compromise or defend the language? Do we sacrifice some words when the second or first meaning becomes extinct? For the word faggot did not mean gay, and because of Christianity we have use for it. The word nigger did not apply to only one ethnicity when it was used and because it is a word of specific value we have use for it. So until you, the masses, have remedied this for me I will offer new words for myself. Now the word fickle-girl means faggot but does not pertain to homosexuals for it can pertain to any person and is mostly pertaining to men as the word faggot would. Now an igno-slack is a nigger but it does not apply to any ethnicity but can apply to all and all genders. Now the country in which I reside has a problem with those who would be righteous but quickly renounce their righteousness forever to become jelous fickle-girls, the men, since it is very rare to find a female fickle-girl and then if you think you have found any is likely that you blaspheme the concept because it is very rare. Now there is a trend of igno-slacks in our country who are white men, and they are grotesque in the uglieness, and many of them are well educated and have become bigger igno-slacks with their different vocabulary by which they do that which an igno-slack would do, being with cowardice and strength at once, their substance being wrath, hatred, and jelousy, that they are leaning into the sick as if to fight them, and speaking like soldiers when they are over-compensating for their jelousy being extroverts even when they are introverts, and becoming strong with each other in their common knowledge of each other’s cowardly deeds and hatred’s that bond them, that they are not soldiers who are criminals, they are not like men, but are bonded in strength when there is none among them who is not guilty of what they have done to disrupt their strength and cause them to hate from insecurity within them. For they walk as men and then stumble as wicked cowards and then walk again and are only men when they have puffed themselves up with wrath. For do they not stumble before the righteous and cling to them as they fall? But they are hating enough and are held as men only by insolence to then be, not men, but men of the devil, being made from what is not good. Now these are grotesque and like filthy and hateful creatures that are ungainly and crippled within. For when they are strong it is so that they are of the devil, but when they are weak it is those missing what the devil can offer them. Now does the devil not prepare his soldiers and are not the minds of his soldiers untouched by the acceptance of and performance of wickedness. For they have opposite minds from you and opposite hearts that to do all wickedness is only become natural for them that the paths and ways are changed that it is an abomination for them to do well. Now these are the common foot-soldiers of the devil. But there are even more dangerous things in the kingdom of the devil although our side is more dangerous than they and are in good, for the kings of the devil are commanding, and they are for commiting murders even with violence as the would come upon the beautiful to crush them and murder them, that they are using great condemnations and judgements of what is righteous that even their smaller soldiers mimic this behaviour at times, that they condemn, judge, and forbid righteousness and good as if the land was theirs as they attempt to claim it. And heaping up strength of perverse judgement and condemnation they are for killing the innocent, even the small child in tears, that they have wrath towards and hatred because of their tears and because the child is seeking those who protect them, there is more wrath because of it and they consider it an outrage that the child would dare to seek God and those who would protect them. For they are even blood-thirsty and I will not relent so that you might not understand and lower your guard. So they heap up substance of hatred, jelousy, wrath, and condemnation and they seek to kill by commanding those who would follow them, using slander and lies, denigrating what is beautiful. And as it is so for the kings it is so for the queens who are in the kingdom of the devil. Now the villian of Ester is with them and he cries often, but only when it is an abomination and not ever in a good way. For you will find this servant of Babylon many places, for my country is Babylon as it is so, and so is yours if it is not theocracy of the type that was Israel. But the servant is a Gentile even when born of Jews, and the righteous are bullies in his opinion, as there is no other thing to call them without confessing the truth. You will find Jezebel in iniquity, being ugly, for she is exalted by the ugly who look up to her as something to attain and be. Ahab you will find being jelous of those he has no right to be jelous of and he will be found stealing away the work of what others have done, to cast it away or steal it for himself and the same you will find him killing in spirit which is to cause to go astray and murder before God when it is fulfilled, but he is of equal danger in the physical ways and doing the same. You are right to save any being attacked by the people who are the devil’s. Now what is perhaps for less obvious truth because I fear God, the leaders of Babylon are having many gods and goddesses, and with wisdom you know it to represent the many industries and groups of consideration, and even the cults that are clung with these groups that are the devil’s, and being that there are many people groups, the Jews being a group, the leaders are being swayed between groups so that they take support from one in order to give it to another group, so that priorities become lost in the mayhem of governing so many different groups, and the Jews and Christians may suffer because of it. For if the Jews should disappear will Christianity not suffer and be attacked more greatly? But I do wish for this to occur. Now the leader might need respectful reminder at times of what will occur because of decisions through legislature and many things become attached to such things. Now if in Babylon you are not petitioning your leader are you being prudent for your people? But the king or queen of Babylon, let us hope they will be for us. Now I have not read all of the Bible and will do so after I have fulfilled what is good, because I do not want much influence from it. Now as for that hatred of the middle of riches I do not have it but  perceive some of it and do not know how to fulfill it. But as for Babylon I would have people know that the kingdom of heaven is not part of it but is the only truth and reality. So then how does any live outside the kingdom? But they are made for what they are made and what is dead for one has substance for another. But if there are even beasts of the devil on Earth that would hurt and kill do you not know that there are those who judge who are with God and if they are not refusing to defend you than they are for you. But are you so blessed when some are not? But I would prefer an Earth with righteousness and truth, that the calamity of the devil when it comes in lies is cast away as nonsense. Now a leorocon is not a father and the Irish have called it such, and those who have no respect for people are not to be trusted in that they have no concern for any and would commit abuse like it was a game. Rapists are among these. Now the one who has no time or use for increasing understanding to do wisely in matters of life and moves hastily to do violence when a small thing of life is before them, are those who are hasty to shed blood and they do so without reason because they can offer reasons even with no small thing when they have tolerated the presence of one too much and hate them to grow with rage inside them, being jelous of them and drawn into rage, that jelousy has come from annoyance and they are communing with their friends that they should go and kill an offendor by annoyance and jelousy and if it is some matter that is for understanding, a matter of daily life, and they have no patience for it, that they would kill, than these are like swift moving killers who come to their target by flying creatures to kill swiftly what they have seen from the air, being a citizen who was in their own country. Now those who would frame a multitude of times for small matters that a person might incur many harrassment more because of it are those casting a net in war that is with sharp objects that will not scar a person and it is a weak weapon but takes patience, for the weapon is wanted to be effective but it is not that which will cause death unless the person is old or has a bad heart physically, and if the soldiers will not save them know that soldiers of the devil have slayn them that they go to the after-life, the next after this phase. Now if they are attempting murder by some method of combining those things that when they are completed will cause physical death and the soldiers will not investigate it, than a saint has been slayn, a martyr and going to the after-life.

Now not being forbidden to harass each other, are you not free to bully and harass each other? But if you are able to bully and harass even using sexual harrassment where you cannot be fired, than are you not being two people who are alone? But if you are married to an animal who is only restrained by the consequence of crime than do you think it good for you to stay with the person as if you were married to one who can be with you? But if one is not ready to leave child-good can they be married when they are not yet 14 years of age? But I do not write about actual age. But does even a child do what the one you are with does? But if you are willing to continue, than what can be done, but if you are departing, than you will not do what keeps you from gaining when you have departed, but if you are for divorce than you will be remaining married until there is divorce, that you be attaining what is good again. Now if you will incline to wisdom than it is for you, and if you will be seeking it, be seeking it early, that the busyness of a matter does not make it so you commit error when the time has come to exercise wisdom. But I know that God is greater than I, and if I am with love than how much more is He? And yet how does he judge and by what standard does he forgive? For I only give wisdom to be as guidance for those who choose it.

Now these are grotesque and like filthy and hateful creatures that are ungainly and crippled within. For when they are strong it is so that they are of the devil, but when they are weak it is those missing what the devil can offer them. Now does the devil not prepare his soldiers and are not the minds of his soldiers untouched by the acceptance of and performance of wickedness. For they have opposite minds from you and opposite hearts that to do all wickedness is only become natural for them that the paths and ways are changed that it is an abomination for them to do well. Now these are the common foot-soldiers of the devil. But there are even more dangerous things in the kingdom of the devil although our side is more dangerous than they and are in good, for the kings of the devil are commanding, and they are for commiting murders even with violence as it would come upon the beautiful to crush them and murder them, that they are using great condemnations and judgements of what is righteous that even their smaller soldiers mimic this behaviour at times, that they condemn, judge, and forbid righteousness and good as if the land was theirs as they attempt to claim it.

So they heap up substance of hatred, jelousy, wrath, and condemnation and they seek to kill by commanding those who would follow them, using slander and lies, denigrating what is beautiful. And as it is so for the kings it is so for the queens who are in the kingdom of the devil. Now the villian of Ester is with them and he cries often, but only when it is an abomination and not ever in a good way. For you will find this servant of Babylon many places, for my country is having Babylon as it is so, and so is yours, no doubt who are not of Salem. But the servant is a Gentile even when born of Jews, and the righteous are bullies in his opinion, as there is no other thing to call them without confessing the truth. Ahab you will find being jelous of those he has no right to be jelous of and he will be found stealing away the work of what others have done, to cast it away or steal it for himself and the same you will find him killing in spirit which is to cause to go astray and murder before God when it is fulfilled, but he is of equal danger in the physical ways and doing the same. You are right to save any being attacked by the people who are the devil’s.

Now the one who has no time or use for increasing understanding to do wisely in matters of life and moves hastily to do violence when a small thing of life is before them, are those who are hasty to shed blood and they do so without reason because they can offer reasons even with no small thing when they have tolerated the presence of one too much and hate them to grow with rage inside them, being jelous of them and drawn into rage, that jelousy has come from annoyance and they are communing with their friends that they should go and kill an offendor by annoyance and jelousy and if it is some matter that is for understanding, a matter of daily life, and they have no patience for it, that they would kill, than these are like swift moving killers who come to their target by flying creatures to kill swiftly what they have seen from the air, being a citizen who was in their own country.

Now if they are attempting murder by some method of combining those things that when they are completed will cause physical death and the soldiers will not investigate it, than a saint has been slayn, a martyr and going to the after-life. Now the devil is giving new substance to all his people so that they might be completed with that which gives them strength and stability, that their substance be utterly clear of all that is of God less the good spread in them and they be made to what is good, but if they are of a heart that is driving the good out than I do not know. But I would guess at a thing, that it is good to drive evil out where it is acceptable and performing what is acceptable. But if you are finding more truth than I than you will know that I do not understand all. Now you being profiting greatly from death that you have more life are doing what is right for you? But I must fulfill and intend to. For by what manner I receive I have perceived the place where the daughter is stolen by another, and fiery swords have clashed close to me and showers of sparks have hailed from the sky while flaming arrows sore and the battle is sounding and travellers are moving through in the night, and yet the room is empty and the moments still and the time is of hot and cold, with blizzards thrashing and taking innocent lives that are for God and the kingdom of heaven that all their great stories I do not know. For I have increased pain in me and the giving even is mixed with sorrow even though I am for fulfilling all. 

They attempted and were endangered and so they changed to attacking in a way safer for them, and perhaps worse, that you know that they, ugly people, are at war with you.

Now one who tells a person to do something before they can do it is attempting that the person not do it, and this common battle tactic by the enemy. The one harrassing a person to do a thing is attempting they not be capable of doing it when they are doing so with bullying and much harrassment, and this is a common battle tactic. The one starting an altercation that it quickly escalates is picking a fight for some purpose, often so they might lie about the person. But as for what kills there is one who would draw another into a conflict that they might feign great anger and kill them. Now you have not done foolishly because they did evil, but if you were in the employment of the devil you would be foolish.

I have incured the displeasure of the Enturi, to know that I might not easily be forgiven for the crime, and yet I am encouraged by the mountain men, who have made their kingdom in the glory of the mountains, who build their houses among the pine trees and great trees that change with seasons, who are bearing the double-edged sword with ability, and are expert with the hatchet and blade, and they are being amongst the glory of the mountains, where smoke hovers upwards, and they would even seek to conceal it, and often do, that they are fond of many products, being the weed that is smoked, and the hard drink that they enjoy, that they are a strong and hardy people, and a big people who have much understanding and weild wisdom as if it was sport. Now we Elsnon and Enturi are yeilding to them in much that they can accomplish because of their ability, and yet the Elsnon have much ability of their own, and of course it is so. But the Enturi are with us, and they are precious and good with those who require treatments of any type, and they are hard for me not to be guilty with, because I know that I am the offendor. Now where do the children of the kingdom of heaven attain more that they might endure what they must, to pass the tests to salvation? But I am desiring that they should not be persecuted, and if they are, than I would desire that no soldier of hell be involved in it, that it is not any business of theirs, for they are ugly and cruel and I am not of the opinion that any Christian from any church should have to deal with them, but then I am not the Lord, and I do not know all that must be. But concerning the persecutions they must deal with, if they are with wisdom, being wise as serpents and innocent as doves, I am having the impulse to say words, to bring combat to those who would harm them, and yet the truth restrains me, and He knows the strategy and what must be, that what would be fullfilled is to be fullfilled and He is even capable of making soldiers from humans who would be sent to protect them, that they might endure better, and that it might be good in the eyes of God. Now as for the church of beautiful people, being the Elsnon that dwell in that church, being the part of the body of Christ that is for light and what is beautiful, and that others have been humble, those who I have communed with in spirit, but they are incredibly pleasing to me, and they are the Christ's. But of the Elsnon, we are dwelling in a land in which the ugly beasts and soldiers of the devil are hating us and are for being cruel, that I would ask the Christ to send us special protection, that we might survive with peace, because the hatred towards us in these ugly beasts and soldiers, and it is against us, to wage war against us. But I have been frail in my ability, and failed to perform protection for them, because in what ability I have been given, I find no power in myself to offer them enough that would save them, for I do not have it to give to them, that they would be saved by wisdom, and so the glory is the Christ's, that He might save them with his protection, because where there are needs is He not capable? But I stand back and away, because I give Him no command, only the spirit that is within me speaks.
	Now I incured guilt with the Enturi and have been wrong in it, and this will be understood of the time meeting them, to be understood, that if the guilt is upon me, it will remain until it is well, and if then the Elsnon are the people I give wisdom to, that they might have the guidance if it pleases them, than I am ascending to something, and descending in another, that God might understand any error and pardon me for what I do, and praise me for what I am to do, that I am still for giving to them and being amongst them, for they are my people, and yet they are not, because of what I am. Now Babylon is around them, and it is in chaos and yet I have sought to give them some order to understand the chaos, that the order was discovered by me, because of the ability from the Lord, and quickly, all of it, as if one who runs and goes quickly, and does what they are to do as they do it, and so I am still for fullfilling all, because I am for wiping out all the philistine of my fullfillment, that people to kill has not been given to me, but the acts that I am to perform are already being apparent. But a fleet was brought to me, with great treasures of heaven, of gold and silver, and precious stones, heaps of it upon heaps, and the glimmering things of kings and queens and spices were abundant and perfumes, and all manner of garments that might be given, and so there is no exausting it, and it is given to them who are being blessed by God, that are being blessed by His son, the Christ, who is giving to them that would endure with the hardships of that which is not beuaitiful, that they await in beauty, and are for attaining many more things who do well and please Him. Now they are to be watching, because the Christ is returning, and when He does, I cannot write, as if I would have knowledge of when it will be. But if you are to be lifted to heaven, being already in heaven in your hearts, than I know that you are those who are capable of watching for His return.
	Now if any wishes to be relevant themselves, by promoting their cause to the level of murder for that which does not concern true moral wrong, than they know well what they do, that they are not like a serial-killer, who kills for insufficient reasons, but they are like a mass-shooter, who attempts to kill for nothing at all other than desiring that many should be killed. If the adam can name the animals and tell the difference than for the purpose of understanding, it is good to understand the difference at times.

Now if Avram (Abraham) gives tithe to El Elyon’s Salem than what do his children do to revile? But let them, the wise of Abraham save their people, them having ears to hear and eyes to see, that because of them there might be peace.

But I have blessed Avram in the right time and places, and bless him in general, and the Hebrew Jews are our allies and there are wise men and women among them, and as Avram has aided me so I have aided them, that they gave to me and I to them. Now Abraham I have blessed and I wish for God to correct the Hebrew Jews in what they do so that it will be known that He has not abandoned them, because a father corrects them who he loves. Now the Elsnon are honouring God, and He is our father, that what is for the Elson is sacred, and we dwell in a place in which we might be in Heaven, though not there fully for the first phase holds us to this Earth, that we are with the good and righteous who keep the Earth from descending into hell, that we will take aid from the scripture and give priority as is only right to our own things, and it is good by Moses that we not focus on what is for another people when we are given better things and much more that it is concealed from the other people, because God has concealed it that things might be right. Now look to God and your own people, and if you bless another people, is it not good?

They attempted and were endangered and so they changed to attacking in a way safer for them, and perhaps worse, that you know that they, ugly people, are at war with you.

Then you will know the wisdom that is of some men who understand, that a child molestor can turn into a very dangerous threat actor very quickly, sending troops, sending out mass murdering of unknown people, not even regarding others of their type, but wiping out towns, men, women, and children in an attempt to save themselves because the sky is falling, though it is the Ocean, as they are sending out destruction in all directions as they thrash and squirm and sink to the bottom of the Ocean with a heavy stone chained to their ankles. 

Now when those who have sunk to the bottom of the Ocean join hands to attempt to float to the surface all of them are under the surface of the Ocean, only they do not wish to attack each other that they might join hands although the surface of the Ocean is above them, that the Ocean is better than them, and it crushed them at times, that they might be filled with terror and amazement, yet they grow with insolence and hatred of the Ocean, saying that the Ocean is foolish in worshiping God and being pleasing to Him. Now the Ocean does not bear sharks, hum bolt squid, evil creatures in a pointless way and the men of the surface are honouring God, and they are like mighty angels to them who are beneath the surface of the Ocean. How will we release ourselves from this prison, this thing closer to hell? Some of them who have sunk have said. But the world has not been without danger, and so they know, and some have cursed God, bitterly.

The wicked have said so long as I have not stabbed them with a sword I have no guilt, but am completely innocent before man and God, but when a person does anything that words are below sentience they are concealing their real motive that they are unwilling to say. Now if the motive is due to guilt why will they confess. For men have endured torture without confessing, and torture will not yield the truth, and is a wrong to us because we are ceasing from evil at a time because we are God’s people.

A soldier of Beelzebub has said it is only a matter of opinion and there is no truth or understanding, and this they have said because they have no understanding, and they have insolence and confidence due to ignorance and lack of understanding, which is their strength.

An angry fool who has no understanding has willed to go out into the land and take innocent people who have no knowledge of what he wants to know and some of them being loyal fighters for his cause, and he has wanted to make them pay, to punish them, and yet he has no daughter or son, and he is angry, and he has said, let us spread torture that those who have no knowledge will give knowledge to escape and I will be great in my evil, to destroy those sons and daughters who did well, who are loved tenderly by God and their parents because I am a brutish and proud man who is not loved in such a way and I will take my vengence upon those who are beautiful, indeed if they are beautiful then I have said my judgement is impaired because of their beauty and so to please God I will do far worse to them than any and I will be a king of men and I will be a hero to women whose sons I kill and I will bring equality to my lowness that I will through my actions destroy all that is better than me and more pleasing to God that I might be great and shun wisdom and understanding and noble learning that the people might thank me as a hero and give gifts to me and I will be their king.

A fool has said, the beauty of innocence has impaired my judgement and so I will be just and please God, that I might punish them more than others, because if they are this innocent than the punishment must be greater, because I know they are guilty, but my judgement is impaired by their innocence.

Now I would have you take it for granted that the people of the devil are engaged in spiritual warfare and this is expected as you know that this Earth is spiritual, with spiritual people, and that the devil is at war against God always.

It is still true that we should kill all the ugly people, and yet if we do not do it when it is in our power it is only to honour the laws of a nation because God is loving us and it is not because of ugly people. But it is forbidden to kill all the ugly people and forbidden to do what this culture calls murder, and I too forbid it, and I only must forbid it to honour God. Now this that is written and declared takes the primary priority that nothing else written makes it lesser in priority because it is foremost because nothing cancels it or makes it nothing but it is the addition to all, being the primary priority, and let no ugly person misuse it, for I would declare worse for them than what any beautiful person would declare for them, that no ugly person would turn a beautiful person against me or I against them.

Now ugly people have hated soldiers in times prior, for they have been with jelousy, being fickle-girls, and yet is it beautiful or ugly to despise those who have commited acts of bravery? --Now those who are being ugly are ugly and this is known, being the second primary concept that can be added to all, that ugly people are ugly and when they would be liked they are not anymore when it is apparent that they are ugly. Now acts of valour are noble and praise-worthy, but if a person is then understood to be ugly they will have no obligation for you beyond what is right. But you are not to be ugly and nothing is required for me to say. But that you honour soldiers is good and right and part of what is good and right. For soldiers are going through many of the trials that the beautiful must deal with, and so I have given here honour to soldiers.

But if the ugly man should rise up to attack and confront the beautiful it is because their father has raped them because he hated him, that you know the depths of their foolishness and evil, that they have rose up with much uglieness, and they are sunk into the mud of their uglieness.

But I do not write about the Enturi, but do the evil regard reporting good when they are doing evil? Do they relent? But they curse good for good, even, as being foolishness, being fools, and knowing it, and declaring themselves wise because they are of some measure of repentance within their soul that they must cast out, for there are evil who are not willing to indulge any morality within them, but when some have come expecting good, they have considered them fools, because of the repentance within them, that they must cast out, for where they call morality foolishness, they are casting out good within themselves and replacing it with evil, that their confidence might not be relenting, and good spread and take over them, but better to let death over-take them, for these are devices of the devil. But though they are proud, they can over-come with pride, and they are utterly void of morality in their attacks, that they test God continueously and test the righteous and their intergrity, and so let wickedness, their own, devour them.
	So they have said you are fools, and they show lack of understanding because of it, and they say this because they are not for admitting they are fools. Let their repentance spread within them.

For as they have withdrawn from all morality and sought to live in envy and hatred, even jelousy, and because they are lacking understanding and truth, and are for every type of dishonourable and immoral trechory, being fools who are base in their trechories as a simple one would attempt to be wise, when they become more foolish, lacking understanding in a way far below all peoples of the Earth and in all history of the Earth, if any are these, let them not think I am giving them wisdom, or that I have come for them, but let them first admit that they are the devil's before they are able to take that path which would lead to us, for so must it be, because of understanding.

By the measure of any group's insolence, they will be delt with by the truth, that those who are pleasing God are not offended by the truth unless it is something of what should not touch them, but does because of the insufficiency of accuracy, that they are being close to that battle which protects them, and become mauled a little by the heat upon some places, that so it will be known that anything I have written in the matters where it is not right, are not for any to speak, being those things that are not permissable to speak in public or any place, because they are unacceptable, but the people who are beautiful are not accustomed to fiery swords and truth that is not for them to be touched by that would go out to keep their garden safe, that two fiery swords are protecting the two books that are contained within this, and they move in every direction and are not required for those who would not attack. But some things are for defence and other things for the truth to be understood, that what is true, is truth, spiritually in some places, that the Elsnon might be capable of knowing that the angel is one of them, but not one of them at the same time.

Now the one who extends and swells, having no substance to extend and swell that is not substance of the devil is having the truth attack substance of the devil and not what is not substance of the devil, that swords of truth are being used on them, because they are commiting combat upon the saints, and those who please God, that if they are cut down, will they expect mercy? But let them find repentance and mercy with the Christ and God, because I have not come to heal those who attack the Elsnon. But let them rage in their tears, when a sword has scatched them, that their tears of a child were not there when they thought to do evil and cause God's people to go astray, because they had gone astray. But learn truth, little child, who wishes to do combat against God's people, that the sword not touch you, but that a sword will protect you, that you are better off with your own people, who will nurse you and care for you, that you might receive good from them. 

But are you a man who attack God's people, that you are a soldier who has fought as a soldier among men on Earth? But let the Christ protect you. For if you war against his people, why do you say that the Christ is beside you in what you do? But strength is for substance, and what is not of substance does not survive the truth when it is brought against you like a flaming sword. Now if you were a man by righteous deeds you would not have been inclined to stand against the saints of the kingdom of heaven, but if you are made of merit, than you are not standing against them and attacking them.

...So I relent and what has been cleared is what was for this. Those who would not be touched have not even sensed heat and are far off.

Now does any attack with truth who is not causing any to stray with cruel ways that are more intense in their methods? But are not these like the innocent, who are easily bruised of foot when they step upon the ground? But why would any wish to even touch one of these to cause them any trouble at all? For these are to be protected in my opinion, and their gentleness is sensed when one has been around them for a longer amount of time. But these are like another type of innocent, who are easily bruised, who are able to sense heat, who hate evil, who are to be protected and treated exceedingly well, that they are for treating others well, though they are not defenceless.

Now what is the Ocean? But the wise are reasoning that it is of the standard of men on Earth, and that of women on Earth, that the Ocean is on Earth, and God has made it, and it is benificial to be in heaven. Now what is land? But is it not for the living things? But in the Ocean are living things. Now what is the moon, and what is the sun and what is the mountain and the forests? But people have dwelt in forests, and are not able to see far because of it. But mountains are great and they cannot be removed except with heavy means, and deserts are not entirely desolate, and I have been in the desert prior, and due to what occurred. But it is my opinion that the desert is better than Sodom and it is even better than that which was in the book of Isaih, but that is my opinion. Now there are people among you who are to be watching for the return of the Christ, and some are saying that there is nothing real in any of it, as if nothing happens in the two realms, being the spiritual 'Mala' and the physical, 'Ria' as if both were not the ways of the Jews, as if only one is in the New Testiment, that some are saying that only the later is not part of any scripture, and that the religion only concerns the former. But if this was true, than there would be no after-life, and perhaps no God, and this is even neglecting sociology, if you believe that Mala does not control Ria, when it does, that God is real and has absolute power.

The wicked one driven back for a time returned that they should have been delt with completely. If one would be angry at you I am not, only their second attack is worse than the first? For if they attack now with allies do you think you could have done more? But are any believing you to be a god or goddess who would have done war? But if you are being persecuted than Christ is with you. If many are against you is it not right to flee to safety if you can? But if you are not accustomed to such things the world is changing because of you, some being as if not married and not a parent because of it. But are you truly to be counted lucky if you are neither if more is brought against you yesterday or the month prior? But know that heaven is where you are. Now one does not die but has done much evil and another dies who did much good, and a man thinks himself the king of such matters? But life and death is with God. Now it is right to trust God because He has power, but if you have lived with small means of going astray than do not soldiers do more than this on an almost daily basis. But why would I judge? But I do not ask any to go astray or recommend it and yet you might know that I myself do not perform so well as some of the saints. Now if their minds are stubborn than so are their hearts and if they say Babylon, my country makes it right than neither do they wish to go astray. But the women who saved the children of the Jews were praised for fearing God? Now what are these saints and what have they come to, but forgive the world, God in Heaven, for their heads would rupture and blood would spill from their eyes to know what they do. For the saints are not like them who would be blameless before God because they have kept the will of Babylon, but the saints are being more blameless in ways than some of the angels, that any should stand in prison when they have a chance of escaping, to not attempt to use small evils to escape. For do not even soldiers attempt to escape? But are these like soldiers but more innocent lambs to be slain. But being lower than the angels they are exceedingly humble, that it is right for them to think of angels as they do, only I praise them, and does it cause them to sin? But let me not cause any sin among them. But if they are of lesser ability and angels are to be the Christ's, than let it be so understood that the saints have endured what angels might not have endured. For weak and not as capable as they are, they are to endure what the Christ endured. Now it is told that they will not be given more than they can pass, and the tests are moving for some to the profiting of death, by which they profit and gain. Now if any should be hardened to death, that the lake of fire would be for them, than it is the will of God that the wicked be preserved in their wickedness. For if they are to be perverted by encouragement from those like them, than what manner of people will they be? But religions have rose up from insufficient knowledge and understanding and if any is to be saved, let it be because their situation was difficult.

If every problem a person has is solved by comprehension of reality that is taken for granted and is there immediately, what manner of person is it? But is it a human or something else if the person does not seem to be sentient? For does it know why it is doing anything? Now if it does not, than what profit is there in speaking to it? But if it is still being aggressive and the soldiers will do nothing than how can any say that the government is not against you? But who do you then turn to? For they have attempted to remove people from employment and put them on the street as a homeless person because killing them would not go unpunished that the corrupt official would say you may do this evil to those we hate but you may not kill any of them. So if you were spared are they persecuting those who would be with you? But there are beautiful people upon the streets here and though there are no fires anymore or flaming arrows they are given up to live or die and not able always to recover from what occurred. Now what has gone out from the corrupt leaders that would agree with those corrupt in the government that they may not kill but they may make them homeless that their voices not be heard against any who has commited wrong. Now I would not be surprised if it erupted in violence and yet a movement was pushed further and hi-jacked, perhaps by those who lead it, and the guilty have gone to those above the Ocean to draw sympathy to say, these will destroy all of us. Now if the city is swelling with those who do not have the power anymore to give aid, than what has been dissolved and only to remain in image? But there is much crime that cannot even be judged anymore due to the poverty and lack of aid. Then for other matters, I will mention the cults of Earth, that are, some of them exchanging morality for judgements of what is not wrong and not morality, that they are not people anymore, but types of anti-people, being the opposite of people in what the judge,  that you cannot understand them and they are frustrating for some to deal with. For they do not judge what is wrong by morality but judge what is not wrong according to their hearts and doctrine. These are not always soldiers of Beelzebub but they can seem so, although they have been encouraged in their heart’s alteration by the cult. Now they have been given new structures being a new paradigm that is not natural for humans and shows a lack of basic human understanding. These are having evil that they seem to think is justice against what is not wrong. For this is another cult of the devil that exists in Babylon.

Of course the heirchy of needs has been seen as good although ultimately in error and for what it is for. Now a person who needs food is clearly unable to pursue anything else, and if the weather is bad, than the same is true for shelter. Now operant conditioning is to be within its limits and does not account for sentience and the ability to reason and problem solve. What am I to say? Are they attempting to sow discord between psychology and humans? But there are people who have joined terrorist groups because their real problem was a gland malfunction. Now is it meant to be? But they have removed primary rights and freedoms in some cases to attempt to normalize what cannot be normalized due to the limitations of humans. We live in a century of fire and iron and the dungeons are having more innocent people. How can any be ignorant anymore except the strong hand of the media does not report most of it. Life continues, is an expression I have produced, but should it? Change is required but there is no great aid that has come. The food is given but people cannot get out of poverty and how can they even serve God in such situations? But I am for not judging the poor because they are not only poor but not able to be held entirely accountable due to what occurs. 	

I have noticed how quickly any cause of a person can change to an INCEL cause of jelousy towards a beautiful person, in that what a person was upset about is not worth mentioning when the person can use what they were upset about in an exxageration to cover for the idea that they are in fact a self-motivated INCEL terrorist in some matter, who is motivated by jelousy, that they have no mechanism within them that desires to hault them from being a jelous person who might be percieved as jelous, and not possessing this mechanism, become an unashamed INCEL terrorist very quickly, where any matter can be excuse for any crime against the person, so long as the person is beautiful. How any more commited INCEL, with an established history of being a INCEL has a problem that a person with sexual addiction might have when they are not recieving what they are addicted to, confuses me, as I am certain the same effect can be produced with other problems. But of course an INCEL person does not have the same problem, and no unnurtured sexual addiction will in fact incline a person to adopt any of the traits of an INCEL. That an INCEL will be openly jelous without shame, openly attibuting the concept of membership with a terrorist organization with a cause that would be too extreme for terrorists, seems to demonstrate a departure from common sense and indicates a strong belief in puritanicalism as a zeolous religion, even though they would be hypocrites due to their acceptance of 'whore-mongering' (Bible) which means paying money for prostitutes. What is the case is that many of those who have become ready to become an INCEL are only progressing from a state of not having a people group to joining a group of serial-killers to become such, so that the person joining such a group can be viewed as a jelous and hateful serial-killer who does not even follow the norms of serial-killers in that they are motivated openly by jelousy and a doctrine that is beyond sentience and sanity, being in possession of doctrine that is beyond human capacity for how honest it is to utter perversities of a wicked people and jelousies of an unashamed, animal-like honesty, which is dishonest, and strays from truth and reason with its lies and grotesque nature in which it utters the id with a below human grasp of concepts so that it is like looking into the low utterings of a animal-person who is spilling out the confessions of lack of righteousness in a way that lacks truth and is an abomination. Such heavy self-hatred has effected the capacity to know much of anything anymore, so that such are dissociated from what truth was instilled in them. These are with dirt, skin, fur, and blood, and the unseemly mess of wickedness and calamity, that they seek to mutilate when they have mutilated themselves, being sicophants, serial-killers, brutish and foolish weilders of words that exault oneself and speak of self-hatred and self-pity, the violence of them being unclean. These are abandoned by all people, and cast away from all who do not want to be with them, and without a people, they have been taken into a gang of serial-killers to be the most effective weapons to destablize a nation and attack it from within. Enemies of a nation would fund them if they wanted to destroy another country, and they are a great national security threat in this way. If there is another group that one would speak of, it is the lower priests and students of the wise people of The Tower of Babel, who are described in the books contained as part of The Diary of Lucifer being the wise people of Babel who build it and have lost control of the lower priests who are not in Babel themselves but have gone out into the lower places of nearby towns where many dwell to be weilders of much ignorance that comes from their own hearts and priests to do the will of Babylon, and these are not all beautiful people, and traitors from those who are beautiful have desired more to be among their ranks that to remain loyal to those of beauty. For some of these have sought to afflict the beautiful like those who break into a house and afflict those in it when the keepers of the house are away, and so is the will of the devil to pollute their minds with foolishness to have the lack of fear to do such things, so that the Elsnon will know and not be deceived when there is a matter for them in which to protect their own and even others. For we live in a time of fire and iron and cities that have arisen to be filled with wickedness, that these truly are the last days, as are all of those days after the Christ. Now the wise are watching for abuse and those capable are helping with wisdom if they can, that we are not a people who are not concerned for others, and are knowing that lies are in the mouths of abusers and every type of acting and trechory that they are capable of understanding, so that even if those most trusted are the abuser, we are dealing with matters wisely and we are taking those attacked by the wrist and out of the abuse if we can.




Of course the heirchy of needs has been seen as good although ultimately in error and for what it is for. Now a person who needs food is clearly unable to pursue anything else, and if the weather is bad, than the same is true for shelter. Now operant conditioning is to be within its limits and does not account for sentience and the ability to reason and problem solve. What am I to say?

But I am for not judging the poor because they are not only poor but not able to be held entirely accountable due to what occurs. 

Now if Avram (Abraham) gives tithe to El Elton’s Salem than what do his children do to revile? But let them, the wise of Abraham save their people, them having ears to hear and eyes to see, that because of them there might be peace.

Now I have looked at the battle that can be fought to consider the Elsnon and know that though we are very capable, and yet by time we will begin to disperse and diminish without the Christ, the son of God, and that to be without Him and his special protection is to eventually be falling away. Now if any becomes dead, as if a desert that is like dead, than the Christ also was made this way prior to His death, that He was being slayn, and He was. Now God is not a fool and to the one who has been poisoned you know that God is not a fool unable to judge and know what this thing is. For if any feigns lack of caring it is only because they are with anger and hated. But the ugly are for hell, and they are a disease upon the Earth, while you are a light. Do you not know because they are a desease that they will be jelous and with hatred. But if any of them should wish to meddle as if they were of the Elsnon it is from anger and hatred that the would be as if one of you, and if they do so much than the anger and hatred must be even greater than what they do.

Now if any is saying, they have not fulfilled and so I will not fulfill what is for them, than are you being a person who is praise-worthy? But you are not fulfilling because they have not that chaos might come and you might be pety and not doing your good for God. Now if one is not fulfilling than it will be delt with the correct way and God is capable, and if you are a judge of wrongs in court and you are saying I will not give them justice because they have not fulfilled all in the matter of some cause than are you fulfilling before God, as if you would throw of your role and be like a mere person on the street who is bias and is regarding little? But if any fool is judging their own case like a wicked man exaulting himself before you do you not perceive? Now are you being entitled to something by man and spirituality and yet you do not consider that you are given the greater power and so the greater burden? But make not the Lord’s places of judgement a mockery, because you are given a righteous seat that dispenses of all pety children who seek to strong-arm you to fail, who would tempt you to sin. Therefore if none will be for God, than God has the great strength and power to support you. But if you perceive spiritual things than you are knowing what you are, and not a wicked man exaulting themselves as a meddler might claim, but a righteous judge who is with strength and power who God supports with greater strength and power to keep those who would be pety children as allies in their due place, that their words to entice you to sin would be kept in subjection, for they call to each other in the street and do not know, they prod and pull, being not the righteous one given a special place in God’s place of judgement. They do not know the holy and the greatness, and yet they are squabbling and meandering before them who are like the anointed of God. Now a meddler reads honouring advice and yet it is beyond them if they would think it is for them, because I too cannot come between the judge and God and would not want to. But are the words for the meddler that it would be shown that they do not understand and do not respect God’s doings as they should? But nothing is ever for the one who meddles, for they are like a child to be cast out, and they would even say such about prophets and God if they were offended, as if the prophet was a mere man and as if anything was truly known to them.

The adults know their type if they are favouring, and the opinions of the unjust, the wicked, have no weight in matters of justice. But the favour of God is good and better than all favour that can be given by deceit, that to go with God is exceedingly excellent, that the open reward will be revealed, and if not then for some purpose. But there are those wicked loathing the open reward because God has made one rich in something with the reward and some of them, being not segregated from the spiritual in their conversations, that they all know what they are, are then conspiring saying, God has made them rich and it is unbearable for our wickedness, and was not Jacob favoured until the reward to him was revealed? But Jacob did no evil to the herds of another, but he gave more to what should receive more, being a just judge over the matter, that he also tended and gave to the flocks of another what they were owed. Now they have become like small children with pety judgements that are not with understanding to accuse Jacob of evil. Some have been worse to be like Pharisees who accuse beyond the human measure when a person does no wrong. But some, and I speak of men and women, have been small children to climb upon the righteous judge who is supported with a great strength of God, that they might attempt to strong-arm, to prod, to push a little, and the judge is not like a mere man, but if they push and prod, yet the judge is supported by the great strength of God and His righteousness. So the children have squabbled, spoke a little bitterly in a minced fashion, not able to know all the judge knows who is with the righteousness of what is not a mere man.

Now if some beings in heaven used both technology and the spiritual even when visiting Earth would you say it cannot be when the scripture never claimed it could not be so? But would it be a problem for some of you if God’s servants have utilized industry? But if God’s servants have had mines for industry on far away planets being both spiritual and using technology would that be wrong? But humans use technology and industry. But would that mean that God is not all powerful who created the Universe? But if there is much you do not know than why would you relent in doing and being what can know more? Now if the beauty of those things in the book of Ezekiel are lost to some it is because the prophet was not exercising great amounts of writing in describing so that I have believed it to be far more glorious and beautiful than might be assumed, that the hearts of people not perceive blasphamy and perversity due to the small amount of description, for I would explain that He is all knowing.

So much hatred they forgot it would not matter and cannot even be excuse for real judgement, so much intense hatred they should have been killed, so much anger they were not like humans.

In my century there are people who lack understanding due to the great exaggerations of fictional stories and acted portrayals that are exxagerated so an audience can understand. So there are fools who will do evil that is great and believe it to be nothing, and they have not heeded the correction of older people when they were children to tell them of their error, so that they do not understand that humans, by nature, cannot adapt to a different standard of wrong and even abuse and that attempts to do so cause problems for them. My own generation is not portrayed accurately and when society reached a limit with the previous generation they began to give us what we could not want as if to sell it to us, and some sought to cater to foolish ugly people as if we would want it. 

Lacking knowledge they swelled with lack of substance and exalted themselves, being poor in something, that they might claim that none was greater than them, and better was the one who paid for help and was righteous enough to have it, and yet was despised. These two were very different, and the one who was despised was kind and good, but the scorn of some was not perceiving all, and so there is nothing to correct for these. But as for the one who lacked he joined a group that was already of crime but not of violence, and he acted foolishly, but it was better for him, being better than the one who had no understanding and little knowledge who was for carrying out violence for sport.

To the eldest daughter the one edged sword is given, and keys, to the younger daughters the bracelets. If there is another, than the symbol may be worn if it pleases any, being the symbol of the diary that is for the Elsnon.

The person who will not reason, even in the matter of argument, is simply harrassing out of anger like an act of violence, throwing off every rebuke without any toleration, being as if a person who will not even admit that they are held accountable by right and wrong. This is an act of combat commited by some ugly people in society. Now if an ugly reviles you in rebellion than they fall to your feet, bowing before you, for inferiority is known by such a type of reviling that is the reviling of rebellion. But because of prudence you will show yourself as an adult, not denigrating the person in your speech as you discuss the matter with the soldiers, and using no profanity before them unless for some reason it must be. Showing yourself to be an adult who is even considerate of those who hate you, the soldiers will be more likely to endure your complaint, that you are accepting their judgements with patience while you are with them, that you might make it easier for them, when they are receiving good from you. For do they not deserve good when they are for protecting what is right? Now if any is saying you tell tales to those who are against us as if we are all prisoners, than it is understood by you that the soldiers are your gang, as if to be friends who are with you if there was truly anarchy, that your gang is far more powerful than any, for even those who fight other nation’s can be for you if it is necessary. But as you are being a good citizen who is not commiting crime, you might be gaining what is good by a good way.

Now an ugly child, and I do not speak of children, is part of that group that is ugly, but to be a child is not ugly, because you know what is not to be confused, that for every queen who is beautiful there is an ugly queen of the soldiers of the devil and God is above the Earth, and He is superior, that the beautiful are superior to the ugly, and the ugly are for hell.

Now to be an Elsnon a person must be a Christian, believing in the Christ and that He is the son of God who died for our sins. For the Elsnon cannot survive forever if not having the Christ, because the war goes on and the Christ must be there. Now I would recommend to the Elsnon that they seek those translations of the bible that will render to them more accuracy for the purpose of gaining wisdom. Now if the two books that are one book that are written by me are translated to another language the originals will be preserved in a prudent and safe way, and if any should alter the religion than you would be doing well to know of it, only I do not desire that separations should occur due to those matters that can be resolved. Now I have been like John the Baptist who was Elijah who came to Earth, being born and being able to perish as Elijah would, before being rescued to Heaven, and such is the case of all the saints, that they are taken to Heaven. Now the mother of Jesus conceived without a father and with Elijah this is not claimed in the scripture and I have considered it wrong to compare myself to the Christ in this matter. But if it should be understood that what is in Heaven can come to Earth in this way, I would have you be of common sense in how you deal with such a concept, not being guilable when there is no larger cause to believe it is so. But if any come they are the same as if not until they attained what they would by God in their life on Earth, and not what they were before their birth on Earth. Now he said, I am not the Christ and at a later time He said, I am. Let the wise explain these matters that you understand that a person does not claim to be something and people believe in a guilable fashion. Now if any says they are an angel then let it be so, but if it is not, than what do they speak? But I would have you then say, so am I, which is better than to say, no, and degrade. For an angel will know it and is for fullfilling. Now if any will not save your life, but will kill you if it is safe to do so, or if they have a chance in which there is risk, and another says it cannot be so, are either to be trusted? But you are not a simple people easily deceived, and the landscape is much like lightning and bandits and open plains of desert and rocks where men bear swords and knives and there are no soldiers to protect any. Know that in such a place you are of a people who are capable of much. For if you are in a city of fire, iron, and dungeons where many innocent are cast into prison than know that there, too, you are a capable people and that you should be exercising wisdom so as not to test your people as one who turns stones to bread, and relies upon sin to save them. But if you are requiring aid than know that it is right for your people to help you, for you are of a beautiful people.

Now a person has gone out when someone has commited wrong because it was a matter to be punished, and the soldiers who would punish heard the cause and would have pety bias with it, that they rebelled against the judgement, and cause was what I call the Zal which is for the lanit which is the smaller war of bias, and so there was a lanit, being a type of war, between those who agreed with judgement having loyalty and those who did not agree with the judgement, being disloyal, having the Zal and lanit as I call it. Now if the Zal and lanit was with the one not beautiful than it would be declared that the Zal and lanit remained, except the person was beautiful who had been done wrong and spiritually the Zal and lanit fell away because the war of the ugly against the beautiful has taken the greater priority spiritually and takes the place of the Zal and lanit because the war of the ugly against the beautiful has much greater weight in the spiritual realm. Now if any ugly would seek to bring anything against the beautiful than let them remember what is written here.

Justice is not without judgement that one thing is not good where another is not bad, else there is nothing for any grievance towards anything. But it is sometimes and not often the case that the person who would do something enough times will not be badly touched by coorection that is a wrong correction to use on the person who would not do something many times for whom a very small rebuke goes deeper into to them than 50 lashes to a fool.

Now if you are about to die from poverty will you become a servant of Babylon? But who is judging the person who will become this when a person will die because of the starvation, for the hunger and thirst for anything is a great thing to bear and can any withstand it? But do not think I speak of anything that is not so, truly. For if a person will give a false confession to the one who will not accept that there is complete innocence because it does not matter and changes nothing, and it is so, than why would any who has sinned and cannot pass the fullness of tests without the Christ with them, accusing any of doing wrong? But none are even able to judge those with the Christ, and this is His, when they are not passing every test. But let the things of the Christ be for Him, and the things of men and women, for them to judge, for what is the Christ’s is not for the servants of the devil to judge, or even for those of the Christ to another who is with the Christ. But if you are not able without Him than by what means do you judge what is for Him? Now the Pharisees are saying to the Christ, a man, throw yourself down and they have not gone up. But the time and place for the angels is known for where it is.

Now a person is given the advantage of being God’s, even those from Heaven, and by their choices they are some becoming that of the kingdom of the devil. Now if they are for hell, and becoming soldiers of the devil they are re-incarnated on Earth while they still draw breath to be soldiers of the devil, themselves sometimes being deceived and ignorant as to what they are, that the devil would not want them to choose repentance. But let them know it that they are able to repent if it is within their ability, not being too stubborn. So the angel who would live is stealing away the soldiers.

Personal note: I would like to find those who seem to be real prophets that a multitude of them might be published that the false prophets will be seen as false and the prophets might be known before the people. Using self-publishing technology and paid distributors I would like to begin a publishing house for aesthetic fiction and complex fiction as well as religious works that might be benificial. True religious works will be published that are giving prophet revelation or revelation of the spiritual with regards to Judeasm or Christianity. I do not expect that God will judge me for opening free speech if He should judge any who give lies, for I open the market on the righteous and the wicked that God might judge, that I would do what is fair for freedom. What is clearly foolishness in a clear way, however, will not be published as the market has some regulations that we not degenerate to destruction. However I want to be open minded to even that which I do not understand so that great treasure of priceless value might not be lost for the people who do not all believe what I believe. So I have wanted to be fair but not foolish in fairness, as an exxageration, which is to write open minded as well in what is to be published even if I do not believe in it or understand it. If the angel will allow you than you will also be tempted to follow God with offerings of good and honey, that an open hand will gather but a clenched hand be excuse for recompense by God, if fairness is not offered. As for the zeolous fools who are animals in the devil’s army, we will shut our ears to their noise.

The jelous bully has become so accustomed and comfortable with their evil that they are feigning in hatred being offended by those things that are beyond what a jelous person can be jelous of in their attempts to bully, saying you may not walk, or you may not breath, and this is a very intense bully of intense hatred, who wishes to crush the person they hate into nothing and death. Indeed when one acts this way they are like a beast that is sick and murderous that they might be dangerous with their horns in their inward rage and wrath to kill another. For the one who interferes does not meddle if they are for taking a person by the wrist out of that place to safety.

As for the zeolous fools who are animals in the devil’s army, we will shut our ears to their noise. Any religious writings that command violence are of course illegal, but not so in the context of a religion so that no disclaimer is required. How am I to judge such a thing when Babylon has issued a decree that their society as the king or queen wishes to aid it and keep peace and mats in safety, is to hold a judgement of prison time for those who might wish to publish freely and that it is hard to say who will be put in prison and who will not. If anything was to be defended against was it not first and foremost those who would destroy  free speech for every group? But one might believe they wished to punish their own people for disloyalty in some way, and alarmist fickle-girls have gone out into the land to act terrified at what is no threat and attack and destroy all that is of good merit, soldiers for some cause. Now there was an country that sought to ban religion and censored even fiction writers heavily and it is suspected that some in government have attempted to slowly transform our country into what they were, having been dismayed by money and loyal to what they were because they were a country who hated money in the way it might be seen as evil. If they were good intentioned they seem to have shown no descernment for if a man used a hammer on wood instead of an axe, or used an axe on his neighbour to attempt to slice wood than he is incompetent and a madman.

The injured antelope stayed close to the angel so that the angel even began to become annoyed, but there might have been predators in the area, and the soul of the antelope was good. The mountain man defended the angel’s peace that the angel might be able to do his work, and the mountain man was encouraging him, being a people capable of dwelling with angels. Now if the mountain man and angel did not go out to do battle against the devil was due to the lack of circumstance. The Enturi was offended but not hated, and she tended well to the sick and resented the presence of one who was not sick in the clinic, for there was no treatment for them. There is rumour of a Jewish woman and a non-Jewish woman the angel seemed to like but what became of it will remain unknown. Prior to the angel passing through Egypt and Sodom by the use of the names used correctly, though the angel has used Egypt for the ideal of black people when controlling a super-power with regards to those who are in North America, the angel who is tenderly loved, having passed through Egypt and Sodom that the angel has compared to the land in Isaiah, and having come there from the desert of loneliness after much disappeared that was, for he had been given great blessing and protection from God, having wives, women not married, and the good words without rebuke, and every type of blessing he could desire, and having it easy to obey God because of the great protection God granted from evil, and then being in the desert after it disappeared, vanishing in a steady way so that he was alone soon, and in the desert he ate of the dust of affliction, and afterwards he ate of it no more. Now the one paying for prostitutes is punished, and the one who is not themselves is knowing, that if one will injure themselves better for it to be without commiting iniquity. For Jesus was slayn in Egypt and Sodom and so let the child of Sodom be cast out, that if they chose what is hard continuously they are for hell and part of the kingdom of the devil. Now the one who speaks pervisity is one who defiles the sacred as a sodomite, and if they are then a hard person of iniquity then let them be standing against the armies of God and those angels meant for battle. For these are devices of the devil, and strong in their iniquity, speaking defilements, wicked words, being of the hatred to do so.

Now what will be done to Sodom and Egypt? For they are sustaining what they hate, and it is made so by their hatred, that they have called the good an offendor, and Christ was righteous, and if they have considered the meek and righteous an offendor and them being saying that we must claim our wickedness and not allow them to dwell among us, especially them who are not from this place, than they speak for themselves and not the good of where they are and it’s people that if they should be giving their loyalty to God it will be lessened from them who are the leaders of that place, that they will be defended by others and not by them who sustain it in wickedness. But if they are called to repentance than they are changing their ways, and the angel is not involved in such, and the Christ finds fault even with His angels. Now sink with the old Satan who is still in existence and drive yourselves hard to hell with him, or I would council you to repentance that I am not involved in, being that of Jesus the Christ.

An open war and public discussion is not always right for doing what is good, because the tiger stalks, and the spider lures, that the threat actors who would kill the innocent are dispatched by those who fight for God. Now when there is a thing that must be told it is reasonable to ponder and find an acceptable way of telling it that it might be acceptable to those who hear. For those Christians who are dogs are accussing His house like Pharisees and some have been Pharisees with Christianity. Now the anti-Christ’s, some of them, are favouring puritanicalism and with it they would replace Christianity, and with it they would accuse those who please God, that they might be an attacking virus in society, and even be splinters of the devil to cause chaos and attempt to cause straying. Now do you think the devil a bad strategist? But no general wants to fight his efforts. But does the soldier of the devil have much ability to bother or wage war on another of the devil’s? But I do not write about the wars of men. But the society of the devil works for those of the devil’s and the society of God for those who are God’s. Now if the one society is against the other, who will win? But the Christ is made dead and then living on the third day and if such is done than the children of the kingdom are having His work credited to us in the matter of attaining the after-life in Heaven. So those of the kingdom of Heaven profit in their death. Now of the church that is favoured by some, what will it profit if not for the Christ and if not for those of the church attaining reward with Him? But the angel who is tenderly loved is for the church that he favours and gives to his own and others, too, might benefit.

The soldiers of the devil are attempting to teach you something, but there is war, and the way of life departs from hell. Now do not let the wicked pull us all down with them, and let them not claim you should fight their war against yourself and God, for they are against all those who please God, those of their own ethnicity and those of another, that the ethnicities of Earth are not often worth considering, unless it is some matter of politeness towards another’s culture and you are knowing what is right and what is not that I am forbidden to offer any command or guidance in this place only to offer my support to those who are beautiful. Now do you believe you have any favour in supporting criminals among those of their own ethnicity. But do not believe it for as you throw the head over the wall of the offendor that God might bless you, and you not be cursed and perish, so too those who do well are with you and you for them. But intensely powerful forces are for you on Earth and in your good, you are to be defended by them, when they are righteous. Now the soldiers of the devil have given you advice and you are not a simple people to believe. For the enemy soldier has said, leave the right action and lower your bow, and what advice would you heed from them, because there is war. But has any said, do not tell you allies? But will you rather go missing at the hands of the enemy? But your side is stronger and what threat will they use when more come with more deadly force? But let those who are pleasing God stand together that you not forget those who are beautiful when they have stood with you, that the beautiful might remain and even conquer so that those of the devil’s might diminish from ability on Earth.

Be not attempting to make a person what is right when that are determined to be what they want. For if a person wishes to be something than they are of that which they are of, that the consequences of what they are might come at a later time. For though you might fight those of the devil’s you do not attempt to convert them when they are determined. So you are a beautiful people and you have a standard, being people with integrity. Now the wise man of Abraham has said among the people to the young ones of Israel, is this how you speak and act towards your elder brother? Now these words are good and meant for what they are meant for, not to be taken too far, but is concerning things of tribes and people groups, because without need of saying it, many of the Elsnon have been accepted as being like younger siblings to some Jews and it is good, for the younger Elsnon honours the Jewish person who is older and likewise. Only the way of Jews is different than that of the Elsnon, although I have benifited from Avram and him from me, and have we not fought together? Now be more concerned with your own things and Moses has spoken as much to the Jews and do not the Elsnon understand without Moses? But I would consider it abomination for you to be like Sodomites in the way of attempting to cause Jews to stumble, for are you to war against God? Are they not also God’s people? But I would not have you regard physical ethnicity of Earth with concern to races of people only this is among you due to cultures of areas on Earth. But beautiful people are of different shades and so the beautiful are upon the Earth. Now a wise Jewish man speaks as a saying to give wisdom, and yet the Elsnon are the younger being not one of the sons or daughters of Jacob, but of a distant land that has heard of the Jews. Now we are to the East of Juruselum, and the stars are over our cities, and villages, that amongst nature, and our land is gold, silver, and wood, and yet we are not a land of milk and honey, as it is for the Jews, nor are we like Egypt, except we are having some riches comparible to them. Nor are we like Babylon, for we are not in chaos, and we have one God, and we are Christians. Now if we are the truly the younger, and we are, than are we not to give honour to what is good? But if any child is cast out, do not be unjust, because such a child is only returned to Abraham, that they are not fatherless and without God. Now as for those who are commiting evil and are maintained without guilt than are you truly believing they are the Elsnon, when a matter of guilt in anything has no guilt for them. But other peoples might dwell among you and if they give birth to a virus of the devil’s than will you be devoured? But I do not believe you have great need to be concerned about those of Jacob when there are people of the devil’s who would be against you and if you will interloper to notice, against Jacob’s children in different ways.

Now if you discovered an alien planet in a far galaxy would you be more concerned with whether you were a molestor of children or not? But if you are to judge anything than can any change what God has placed the Ocean as? But if you are to continue than will you not be in righteousness as best you can? But I will not support these only I would want to do what is right for the Earth, that if I will be given a time where I am not sent to judge than will I not speak truth? But the judgement has not changed with my words and I do not attempt to change the Ocean. Let it be a private consideration then like a duty performed by one whose duties you do not have. But let it be in the diary and the book that concerns many things of war, both, that it might be quoted from that which is not the diary when it is right. Now for the Elsnon it is if you discovered such would you be more concerned about your theft of something that you stole. Do not find in taking things out of context some other religion that is of the devil. For if any should come from the Elsnon who are not Elsnon and they produce children that would turn against us and be against God, than it should be known by them that they are to know the limit that they may be Elsnon.

Now a cult of Babylon that belongs to the devil is for making strong the regard for what men do either justly or unjustly that is not of the pure language or the placing of God and Mala first but is the cult that hates Mala and exaulting Ria. Now this is found in Babylon and not Israel where kings were being chosen and anointed by prophets, because Israel was Mala taking priority that Mala and Ria might be one. Now the Elsnon are keeping to the truth of God that Mala is the truth and Ria is full of chaos and injustice and the prophets of God do not control Babylon. But the one who exaults Ria and is hating Mala is base and low like a dog in the street or one that is mangy or one who dwells in the house and eats of those scrapes that have fallen off the table from the child or given by the child. Now an angry dog that would bark and growl is a stray dog of the street but a dog who would be with you must acknowledge the truth of Mala and yield to it first, that if they are right by Mala and aknowledging Mala than they are not fit to be stray dogs in the street. Now if any are to be stray dogs they are so before the assembly of many powerful creatures in Heaven. Now any person being the least in the kingdom of Heaven is able to pass into the congregation of the Elsnon, but a rich man will hardly enter less he is willing to more than any loyalty to the devil. For those who are separated from Babylon are iscolated and may be attacked, and the persecutions are many, that you might remember better the profiting of death to attain. Now the righteous of Israel are placing Mala first that if anything else is granted it is not taking priority that Mala will still be placed first. Now if the result is things of Ria as well than God is truly blessing a person in this way that they have not recieved by being for the devil but are receiving from God, that they have not been working for any cult of the devil and if it is so they are seen to be this in Ria to work for the cult God has known it is not true, but if they do not, than might they incur persecution? For morality comes before money in all things, and Mala takes priority over Ria. Now the servant slayed all but the son would not slay some or most and was corrected that he was a son and not a servant.

Now to incur favour, to please God, for myself and not for another, the angel tenderly loved, did the Christ actually say what men have assumed when they seem to believe He was offensive or even lieing, or is a closer look required, or a correct translation. For all I offer is not interpretation but aid in comprehension for what has no other interpretation, to mention that your lack of time or your expediancy at something has offered most of you assumptions that are not there, because I will not even blame the language you use. But what is given is sufficient for you and if you are for understanding than you know the limits of a command and limit of a phrase, that you understand your own language. But I would think you have become impatient and you have been given scripture for consideration. Now let it be known that it is an angel tenderly loved who offers you nothing but what I desire. Yet I do not offer anything here but defense of the Christ and would it be required? But I do not defend Him against you but against those who speak more and with rebellion as if to go to war with God, and you I do not defend Him against but you are to be defended. Now because the devil’s devices are mixed in the accusations towards Him I am for defending, only is He not defended in this way for your sake who He died for? But is the angel capable of saving you when he is commanded by Him that can save you? But no man can rebel against the angel because the angel is not His god. Now if the angel is in no way his lord than is he not one who is honoured among you, and he is not then like an elder? But if he is not an elder than he is like it, being a man. Now if you ask of me will you not in some matters ask of him? But you are a people who honour Mala first and Ria second and you know what is right.

Now the children of hell are not children, and the adults of that place are also soldiers, and the large and intensely angry things that shake with rage, and the quick things that are small and all the things filled with perversities and blasphamies of the holy, that infest the Earth in places, that are intensely angry at the innocent, who will not attack their own unless it is for some purpose of deception, who would slay and revile with curses and seize the living by the throat that if any seems this and is not than it is a collection of the evil done to them that is stored up to be witness against those who have done evil. So the elders among you might see and inquire and those who are of good, knowing that there are evil on Earth. But if any is blind than they would be neither hot or cold, but blindness cannot lead those who see.

Now for the things of an iherit who might dwell for what is of much consequence, those who are fearing God are knowing what He will do to them if they are refusing in a matter of great consequence, that they are given much and are bearing more for it, that the young woman who would afflict a boy because of some suspicion that an unacceptable crime was commited against them is a child abuser, molestor, and child killer, and so let the things of the iherit be understood by the Elsnon. The woman who is inclined to attack a boy, any male, because of suspicion that a crime was commited against them, has become the abomination, and the humanity has bleed out of them that they are a device of hell, and their anger and rage might be concealed. Let the iherit have confirmation and let the Elsnon know of what is in the lands of Moret and Norul that fools are filled with foolishness and ignorance and their teacher knows it to be folly, that they send them to be unacceptable to all morality and wisdom to be beaten and killed where no one saves them, to be hideous and chaotic and in insanity and chaos that the one who teaches them is a murderer to many who says eat because it is not poison and jump because you will not die. For the measure of judgement cannot be changed and is forbidden so that wickedness not destroy the land. There are those swollen with ignorance and they exhault themselves in their ignorance that is wicked and foolish, who retaliate against their own shame and hate themselves and say, I will make myself hideous, and my anger will be towards myself that I will drive away and then harass and throw myself down, because I am a fool, and my hatred will cause myself to be killed. For the child has hated me, indeed they rule over me, and only the animals offer me mercy and comfort, for my teachers were cruel to me, being jelous of me as women are jelous of another, and they gave me to death, that I might be ruined, and they cared not for my beauty which they sought to trample and defile, and not for my wisdom that they sought to mutilate. For iniquity even has been found in me because my mouth has spoken constantly against my own flesh. For wisdom was too high for some and so the poor crop was delivered into that which would bring it to death. Now will the devil devour me, when I have been so treated, to be tricked, betrayed, and trampled, that my guides all have brought me to ruin and prepared me even to shut my ears to wisdom? For hated Satan, the old devil, I have more cause than any to wish for your death! For you have robbed me of all, even what would be within myself, and you laugh because you claim victory. Let God throw you into the fire!

An angry woman with iniquity has shown a wicked mouth, speaking of acts of violence, stubborn and iniquitous and harder than a rock of the Earth. Bitterness has covered her lips, and if she should afflict the innocent than judgement will come down on her that the evils of the one who wronged her will be cleansed. A child, a girl-child has placed her foot on her neck in play, to rejoice over her. So only her son will absolve her, and give compassion, that the way is through him if she has afflicted the innocent. Though she has endured bruises and pain she is as if cursed on Earth and by whose fault? But if the father has sinned, he is absolved by her other wrongs that she commits so that she is a tragedy and for what cause? But death has seized her because of the sacrifice that did not come, that she is to be beaten and abused, because of the sins of men she has never heard of or known. For blood was shed in war and an atonement has been required, and those who shed blood have not known of what would be required. For the daughters have gone out to remember her, that they pay honour to virginity, that the blood shed in war is atoned for by her.

The one who is the sister of another who is their brother, the two being separated when they have come forth, the one male and the other female, will not have justice against the other, because if the male and female are both wicked, than does any weigh the spirits to know which is worse? But both have spoken alike and the one is worse, but both are the same, only the male is more worthy? Now if both deserve death than why would one judge the other pardonable? But bring not any arragance from the young one’s to the judge of the land, that an iherit is sacred in the eyes of the angel who is tenderly loved, and the angel tenderly loved will remain far back. But if both speak insolence than what is it if not guilt? But does not the guilty utter and offer all their confession? But the iherit is having understanding and is not  deceived even by the false one who would take his chair when the owner comes.

An angry woman with iniquity has shown a wicked mouth, speaking of acts of violence, stubborn and iniquitous and harder than a rock of the Earth. Bitterness has covered her lips, and if she should afflict the innocent than judgement will come down on her that the evils of the one who wronged her will be cleansed. A child, a girl-child has placed her foot on her neck in play, to rejoice over her. So only her son will absolve her, and give compassion, that the way is through him if she has afflicted the innocent. Though she has endured bruises and pain she is as if cursed on Earth and by whose fault? But if the father has sinned, he is absolved by her other wrongs that she commits so that she is a tragedy and for what cause? But death has seized her because of the sacrifice that did not come, that she is to be beaten and abused, because of the sins of men she has never heard of or known. For blood was shed in war and an atonement has been required, and those who shed blood have not known of what would be required. For the daughters have gone out to remember her, that they pay honour to virginity, that the blood shed in war is atoned for by her. Now the woman sacrificed I have known is the sacrifice that can be another, for a pedophile who has molested children can be the sacrifice for war, so that the battered and seemingly cursed woman will not be required but instead the blood of pedophiles of child molestation are required to atone for war.  Now the life of the pedophile is pure, and he is clean, for he has cleansed himself of his sins to his imperfections, and by his innocent blood, though he himself is not innocent, an atonement is made for the shedding of blood in war. For his soul is for pushing forward the woman when the judge comes, to push her forward that she would be sacrificed instead of himself, and if the sacrifice is to occur so it will be. But a wise woman has said, he will push me to my death with honey and encouragement so that the sacrifice does not occur. Now beyond this my understanding is insufficient, even for the angel. Only the life of two or three pedophiles who are child molestor s can be the atonement sacrifice for one woman who would have been the sacrifice. Sometimes less is required and sometimes more. Now those who would sacrifice such pedophiles should not be arrested by any soldier for wrong-doing that the land be brought to lies that are used to protect righteous men. But the land is belonging to the one who delivers and thus a sacrifice may be required. Now those who would attack to save the lives of such pedophiles are to be offered with such pedophiles, for these are those who would save such pedophiles by attacking people, and they are like the procession for them that they might be sacrificed with them. Now if a wicked man will kill a boy who is a child than the wicked man is killed for the daughters that they might be blessed by the Lord. Now evil will be made to cease by force after the potion of time has been expended that matters that require more will be for a judge.

Now a pedophile who molests children cannot purify their iniquity with wrath and evil punishment, as is the unwellness of some pedophiles that they seek to cleanse their sins by attacking and abolishing those who they identify as guilt for them. Now if he would be inclined to this let him instead save women by offering himself as the sacrifice that he might repent with his head above the surface of the Ocean.

Now a brainwashed person is lacking, because a brainwashed terrorist is a servant and there are no better things among them. For such as they are servants with large armour still they are servants, and they are stubborn to return to servitude for the life of a soldier is considered better for them. A soldier has sought to reason with them but their stubbornness is mindless and deaf that they will not return to servitude. 

Now those unwilling to return to poverty are those not comparible to a son or daughter of the kingdom, but those unwilling to return to such poverty are servants and disloyal and treacherous of heart. So let them be understood to be something unwell.

Now the prince and son are both cast out because they are worthy, being for the Lord’s inheritance. But Babylon was not worthy of them and the noble ones have roamed the streets in search of places to stay, and lamps are in the streets to light the way of the noble, and the heavens are over those who are for kings and queens, that shadows flicker there and they are upon the Earth, their feet upon what is below them entire, so as to know that  God is with them as they are going forth at night. So then let riches support riches and those who have sacrificed have more and abundantly, and let the doors be opened for them and they be recompensed by God more than they lost. For the kingdom is greater than Rome and Egypt combined and greater than Babylon and it comes and crushes Babylon beneath it, indeed it hovers over it.

Now the one who trains a dog to bite a child is not without guilt but the child even who obeys God is one who is obeying the parent.

Now the parent will be blessed by God because of the child who obeys God, and yet if the parent is determined to divorce them spiritually, that is divorcing the blessing than how much more might the obedient be blessed? But should a parent drive away like a charging bull than so is the divorce granted that those determined to be free are made free and a loving God will gather His child. Now if God is giving rewards than will I tell of what He does as if I could know? But who knows the Lord except the son and if I am tenderly loved I am commanded by Him. But there are stars in the sky and by what means I do not know, but David’s sword is with him and he has his sandels, a wipe at his wast, and the stars are over the sky in the night. Now his horn is also with him. 

Let them show truth of cause by their actions, whether they rage against holy places, scorning the prophet’s village from close by, saying that which is like prophanity, and know that men are greater than them and a rebellious dog has no master to defend and barks and growls of it’s own insecurity. So are those who were taught to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, for though they may seem like a tribe they are scattered and gathering fools.

Now again why must any speak of physical ethnicities? But there are many races and the shades are varied and how is the angel to name them all when the races are plentiful and new ones are discovered and within one continent or another there are such a difference and variety that too many would be required to find them all. For there seems no completion of wisdom and truth except that God is all wise. Now not even the Christ on Earth had all knowledge and wisdom and it is true, that he was truly human and came as a man. Now I have found a very noble people who are Elsnon who are of the darker shade and their sons are exceedingly noble and with wisdom, their daughter’s good, that they are close to God, the sons, and are noble as pleasing and good scholars upon the land, being of the king’s house, having the silver chalice but not for being excessive in this, that they are great in some fashion, being close to God, and I will compare them to the sons of Jews in this way. Now these the angel has desired should be Elsnon and their sisters and that coveting these for the church the angel is the angel for, because the church is worthy of an angel, those noble sons and their sisters are covered by him that would be Elsnon and if they will not, than the angel is for the Elsnon having alliance with them, and blessing them, but are they not to be Elsnon? Now concerning the misunderstanding of Noah though these are a darker shade they are not the low and disputable son, but they are of another of the sons who honoured God to keep their backs turned, and let both sons see how he is like them. Now the angel has fury in his depths of his heart that any should speak of him as if he was from some other tribe on Earth that is in need of rebuke. For if God has made princes than what will any of a foolish tribe speak? Now it would be pleasing if more wisdom was understood and not those false tribes that the people of calculation in the secular have named because those are for some other purpose and do not profit much. But if you will know one tribe from another, it is benificial that separations be made that other tribes not be slandered and spoken of unjustly.

Now those who would seem blind are not blind to what they must see for even if it was so, none is innocent because of blindness. But if any is plucking out their sight many times a day, attempting ignorance are they not like those rejecting God in favour of the lies of a cult of the devil’s. Now those acting in conformity to lies are like a soldier of the devil’s who is attacking others, and indeed they are. Now what conforms to lies is trusting in the devil’s strength and what is trusting God is mantaining righteousness that is reasonable because the Lord is God. Now the one who does wrong and is reasoning it is not, is that person impairing themselves that they conform to a lie. Now if any tribe on Earth is truly conforming to a lie than do not think they are better, for they are attempting mild themselves among your people and their whole tribe is separate and conforming to a lie, that these are not compatible with truth, so that it does not need to be said that I do not write of any shade of person. But Christians and Jews are both conforming to truth and the Elsnon cannot survive without the Christ, but they are supportive of truth that they are not a tribe of Israel but a neighbouring people far off and yet not out of knowledge for their distance. Now so far as the young are not speaking any lie about the other there is no offence and the pety bickering and games of the young are expected that the elders of Israel and the Elsnon have said let them not bruise each other, but it is benificial that we are being just to both to take fulfillment seriously that the people can dwell with each other when they do. Now if any seeks to take from God and Avram in speech are they not speaking unjustly, and like-wise of taking away from God, the Elsnon, that there is also the Christ there, though it is not mentioned against the Jews. Now among Jews you are God’s and in keeping with good you are also the Christ’s and let him who has understanding read it and understand. Now if you are God’s among the Jews know that the priest of God’s, the lord of Salam has fought with Avram and the two have aided each other. 

Now I inquire of the people, for does the complaint come about Sodom that I might venture there, or from another place? But is it so that the devil has prepared his soldiers with lies and foolish conditioning like people who would slaves, like disposable soldiers, and not those of great worth, the warriors of the king or queen? But has the devil conditioned them without thinking with lies that they might have ignorance to fight God, concealing with tact every attack they should carry out against God’s people, that anti-Christ’s have conditioned them, those who loathe God, and believe they can win against Him, for some of the devil’s soldiers he has kept blind to be more effective and some are well knowing and knowing well that they are at war with God, that the devil communicates with the hearts of them who would go to war against God and are blind and more ability is for those who are knowingly with him. Now the Christ was removing blindness but still those not made to see could not see and the angel is for giving wisdom but if any disagrees that allow them their freedom to be ignorant. For God is favouring that you not do the work of the devil against His strategies and in His name, that you have been clearly commanded and you know that He is the Lord so that you not be counted like an attacking traitor. But how can one of great liberties be judging any in this thing? But let the Christ decide for me that I not attempt to decide for you because I am not your judge in anything, but a servant of the Christ, the angel tenderly loved. Now think I could not betray you? But I am not the one who saves you, that you not lean on the angel when the Christ is Him you should lean on. But if you are for worshiping me than I am for abandoning you, because it is hideous foolishness, despicable and unknowledgable. But if you are not like Abraham who hurried to prepare a meal and welcomed the messengers in the haste know that I have the Christ and I am not taking for granted the good of men who provide and lend aid. But if you would worship an angel go pick yourself up and throw yourself down like a fool before the air and wind for the lack of knowledge it represents.

Now let it be understood who would commit blasphamy that some might say My brother is missing and I do not know what became of him, that no repentance be found in them, unless they are more worthy. Now let them say I will not obey and I am refusing right that it is not required of me. So you speak well, that the blessing is for them who are worthy, that you not have what belongs to them. So for one it is not required that the reward and blessing is for another, that their hearts are loyal to their place and deeds that they do not betray the fulfillment and testimony of themselves. But if Avram, Abraham, is still in Israel I will for pleasure and curiosity pass by his door for I desire to show God what he has chosen, that He is capable of exercising power.

Now the concept of meddling, of becoming involved in something that is for others and not for you, of forming opinion and conviction openly about what is for others that a person might become involved, I have called vadish that it is the concept. Now those of the devil’s house do not refrain from vadish when it concerns one of their own, and sometimes they are refraining. Now if the kingdom of heaven is refraining from vadish may it not be like a dog who does not know when to obey or not, but let them not take knowledge to make them sick and foolish in anything. For a person does not obey all wisdom that they might truly be understanding the wisdom given. For these understand the limits of the purpose of giving wisdom that it is not for making a person foolish. Now if you refrain from vadish is it with overly firm obedience that you let your Allie die to obey wisdom. But let the sorrow not be so that you have taken into yourself what was for another and not for you, that in gaining wisdom you have known the limits whether it be not at all for you, a little, or much. But let the Pharisees accuse and they will impair themselves because they speak against themselves and will they say, it was only in sport that we wickedly accused? But let them who are for God attain what is for them that a corrupt teacher not steal it away and cast it to the wind. But for what is good, I would want them to attain.

Now I have remembered her but is she dead or alive and yet if she is alive I know that I am with others that if they will not soon who are not known to me give me what is right for them I am to accuse them, and let the Christ judge if it is right. Now what revenge will He do that all is not fulfilled by them? For the servant is worthy of his wage and I speak it only a little prematurely. But the Christ is the Lord and  as they are lacking so they have not given, that who of them is worthy of this, that I might give them a portion of my blessing to be copied unto them? But know that if they cast away the blessing it is their own doing and what work God might do I do not know. For I petition the Christ who gives me and them much liberty, that the poverty of the devil might not be accomplished. For I know if they are rich in what is Babylon’s than they are poor and miserable, like the one who is done hard to, that I am with compassion because I have known of error myself. Now David’s son, I know, was not of Babylon, and it is not often that such are being given such things as God gave, that the devil not lead you away with the misunderstanding. But as for what is not meeting when one is past so is there poverty, being lacking, with others, that Babylon too is stealing away and encroaching upon the kingdom of heaven. But let Babylon fail to understand and rejoice that there might be excuse to do evil to them when it is for them to have hope and expect good. For the angel is commanded by the Christ and his enemies, I have heard, are to be his foot-stool. 

Now the peasant has said we judge you because you have made us jelous, that we have incorporated this as an addition to our morality, and we revile you and hate you because of what is, because you are like a god to us, who makes us miserable, and it should not be. For one is a farmer, the other a shop-keeper, another a banker or dentist, and we all have labour and choirs to our sorrow and burden on Earth, and you come to us like a god to reign in splendour and afflict us with misery. For what is a poor peasant to bring you that would appease you. My daughter is in school and I work hard, and what more can I give to you for your pecense like a god requires it from my hand and I have no more to give so that my heart accuses me to misery because I am not adequate to give you more good as you should be given. Now for the sake of mercy, I have attacked you in defence because I could bear no more and was not well in mind anymore, and can I be blamed? But I am only a man and you are like a god. What can man do in this world but work hard and attempt to accomplish and hope there is something left over after the gods have had their fill. —And the man wept in a heart of innocence because of the misery and sorrow of life. Now the one like a god had compassion and did not blame him.

It is understood that even vainity cannot be judged. Now if any is not beautiful what is good to do for them if something good might be done?Now the peasant has said we judge you because you have made us jelous, that we have incorporated this as an addition to our morality, and we revile you and hate you because of what is, because you are like a god to us, who makes us miserable, and it should not be. For one is a farmer, the other a shop-keeper, another a banker or dentist, and we all have labour and choirs to our sorrow and burden on Earth, and you come to us like a god to reign in splendour and afflict us with misery. For what is a poor peasant to bring you that would appease you. My daughter is in school and I work hard, and what more can I give to you for your presence like a god requires it from my hand and I have no more to give so that my heart accuses me to misery because I am not adequate to give you more good as you should be given. Now for the sake of mercy, I have attacked you in defence because I could bear no more and was not well in mind anymore, and can I be blamed? But I am only a man and you are like a god. What can man do in this world but work hard and attempt to accomplish and hope there is something left over after the gods have had their fill. —And the man wept in a heart of innocence because of the misery and sorrow of life. Now the one like a god had compassion and did not blame him.

Now the gods are not for Babylon if it is to be understood, being the gods and goddesses of the Lord, that if they have by mistaken taken anything from Babylon that they will cleanse themselves because they are gods and of the kingdom of heaven, which is the Lord’s and the Christ’s kingdom. Now the power that exists that I call sefam has gathered what is within its power for the god who is seen on Earth that sefam is within those who with it that when a god is in sight, and if I must tell truth it is not so with a goddess because I must obey God and must not lie, than those who are with sefam are drawn to servitude of sickening adoration of the god, that their being is ill with adoration and hatred of themselves that they envy themselves for the presence of the god, and are of a heart of great sorrow and agony because of the beauty that they adore to the extent it has turned to envy and bitter resentment, that their hearts are seized with servitude to the god from great adoration, that they hate and resent themselves because all they can give is their whole of what they are and it is reasoned by them that much more should be given. Now when there is lack of wisdom there is conflict, even turning to violence at times, if wisdom is lacking, because those who would do good are denied and the way is not made by the god for them that they might do good to the god. Now who can say these are jelous who have misunderstood them to be jelous, because these are not the jelous but those who are of great adoration. Now the servants of the god have made their rightful demand that they be able to give good to the god, which they have deemed is only right on Earth that good might be fullfilled that the god who denies one of them is robbing them of fullfilling what is good, for these are the people who are counted as having been chosen to fullfill this. Now they are faithful and beyond that of others so that the others have no portion in it, for what will be revealed about these who run to fullfill what is good? But let none speak against truth and say it is for the sake of life.

Now a goddess and god is something related to the Elsnon that they are like those giving to Elsnon, being a little higher than them is some things and lower by a greater extent in some things that some that is higher is much higher and some that is lower being lower by a large measure that the height of some things is considered the greatest. Now their are not nearly as many goddesses and gods as there are Elsnon except any Elsnon can become a goddess or god temporarily although for them it is short in time being fleeting. Now the precense of a god is made known by those who attack because they desire servitude from great adoration. Now the angel tenderly loved is transformed to one of these gods when he is more like a prophet and temporarily abandoning while remaining what he is, that he has not abandoned the Elsnon when he is so. Now if something was offered by the old Satan than the new Satan will hope to give what he promised when he lied that people might perish.

Now if there are a type of zeolot in your land that are to be Christian and they are not using their full ability of comprehension and sentience which is sometimes ignored to find excuse where there is actually none so that all can really be said is there is nothing here for consideration yet, that so far I am loyal and useful by being useless, and the zealots are being like those who are zeolous in the way that they ignore their own sentience than know that by sentience it is not possible for them to believe they do good unless they are severely impaired by what is not even mental illness but they are a mentally ill sociopath if they are not knowing what they are and it is the sociopath aspect that makes them so as they would be too disabled if they were so mentally ill. Now if they know they do wrong than what are they? But they are greatly in pride and anger that any has spoken a thing that has not respected their camp well enough that they are a foolish wilderness tribe, wrathful and war-like who are only wanting any war. For they move like a group of bandits to wage war upon holy places and those who have offended them for they are an extremely foolish and war-like tribe that does not keep with Christianity but claims it in a false way and is associating God and the Christ only with them that they are proud and angry where they perceive disrespect towards them because God and the Christ are in their opinion only theirs. Now if this tribe is furious and war-like and casts away good as if it was evil including words of peace or anything righteous from those who are not with them, they are not for considering other people in their isolation, and so the soldiers must use heavy weapons to smash the hardness of their skulls that they might be judged rightly. But great wrath and intense power can be brought against them, and their lack of reason can be reasoned with rifles and knives. Now these are wicked and insolent fools who seek to kill and destroy without judgements of morality, so that it is clear what must be done with them, but it is for the great power of kings and queens.

Now the one condemning the righteous and judging what is righteous is spiritually striking the Christ over the head with a hammer that he is striking to kill, being the hand of the devil’s soldier and the one who has killed the Christ in spirit because they have murdered God’s son in His sight and lifted up their eyes to speak with God, covered in the Christ’s blood the blood of innocence, that the rage of the devil has growled in their mouth to open the mouth of their heart to speak to God, rebellion reviling His house and His son they have killed to speak towards God as they stand neither in hell or heaven but on land that their garments are drenched in blood down to their legs and they are a sight of gore, being hideous and grotesque, that they are brother or sister to the hyena, the vulture, the swarming insects, and those insects that feast upon corpses, that so it is percieved by those who have eyes to see, that the soldiers of the devil are in great rage and anger towards innocence and great violence is in their hearts.

What causes a person to abandon basic comprehension when they are at least of the standard? But if one has abandoned another first abandoned saying that which was spoken before respectful explaination. Now if a person skips respectful explanations when they speak that must come first than it is deemed that they are being incoherent and even insolent. Now I have called this speech failure and it is used by some intentionally because of their anger, that if the anger is harboured and they have no right to be angry and they are speaking with speech failure than they are made guilty and wrong, because they conceal what has made them angry, and with the three wrongs they are wrong by truth, because they have attempted deceit three times towards one who is in truth. Now speech that is in truth will come to agreance with emotional matters but if one tricks with speech when the speak that the other cannot answer without agreeing to deceit than the one who does so is using deceit. Now let not deceit think itself greater than truth, but if one speaks with tricks of deceit than they are wrong because they are what they do and their words give no knowledge that revealed that they might be right. For if their motive is concealed than the truth of their motive is not done, and they are only what they do, forgetting that the other cannot know the thing that is true that they conceal so that it is not and nothing. For those speaking deceit are wrong. Now if any is using speech failures often than why do they build up strength of deceit and iniquity to hurl at another as incoherent madness? But this is like one who pushes in the chest that the person falls and is not at peace with what is done. But you being tolerant of each other know the difference. Now the one building up weapons of deceit is using that which is not clean and if they are in a land of such things than they know it is not a place that is good in terms of speech.

Now the figure stood and surveyed and none saw him at night where he moved in silence and he crept into the house and sliced the throat of one then another for they were both performers of strange wickedness being beasts who mauneuvered around the understandings of the young, that the young could not even find words for what they did, a some were attacked as if to be slayn and the figure understood having understood much. Now when it was disovered the young who did not know said, let the figure be killed for I have not understood these evils they speak, for to them the evils could not be because they had no words for them or knowledge believing they knew all they needed. But the elder ones of men and women were not for it, and having some grey in their hair or approaching it, they went in peace to conceal the bodies, and they deceived the young that the figure would be pursued until they had time to give wisdom to the young. 

An ungrateful man who is jelous has reasoned wrong, because he could not bear what reward he was to be given. Now the injustice happened prior to it and who has done wrong cannot be told. Now if he is in agony to take drastic action than he is not held safely and if he is bitter towards God to take action he does not reason as one who does not believe for he is wanting what is better and is not receiving, being lied to by Babylon and finding those of the kingdom to blame, that he does not enter the kingdom and does enter among the Jews, and because of this, being perceptive to truth, he is hating himself if he has neither to go to. Now let not self hatred and self pity lash out at those who are of the kingdom or of the Jews because if he is truly not the devil’s than where does he turn? But because of Babylon he cannot gain his reward, because of those of the devils and the cults of the devils he is perceiving truth and has not gained the better reward he wants, that this is a man who believes in God and is ungrateful for what portion Babylon has let remain, and so let it be understood that the angel is not praising Babylon but has held it the chief culprit and also the deceptive favour where the portion for him other places was not attained. Now if he has honesty in this he is for a great reward, that I would not say it to justify those who are not for it. But Babylon has stripped him of it and it rises up about him, the pride and lies of the devil that have swept righteousness and good from that place, that envy is left to remain and everything bitter that has less worth, for he had found no place with Christians or Jews and yet is he not eager and having much desire for what is better? Now do not do any injustice until you have rid yourself of Babylon, because the enemy is the devil who has taken from you what you should have gained. For he has been deceived and robbed that he is not for Jews or Gentiles and not for those even who do not believe because he has wanted more. Now anger there is to God and can you blame him for he desires a good thing that Babylon has often been found neither hot or cold but lacking, that lies have been found and the world has grown lacking in good. Now where is his true brother? Where is that of his own that he understands because the blessing has been removed and no king of theirs has come to restore their society.

The mountain man (turem) are men who are capable of dwelling with angels as has been mentioned and a turem many times defended the angel’s peace so that he could do his work. Now if angels can dwell with Jews it is with the elder ones and the kings though why the mountain people should have been so capable of dwelling with angels is unknown, only they have made a great kingdom in the mountains and among the wilderness. Now there are even places of rest for angels there and if any should be among them it is angels. Now in the city where the angel resides the case is so that turem are not many but the work of such things that the turem might do with wise excellence is done by others not like them and it is the opinion of the angel that many of these are fallen from righteousness and holding together the wrong of the city, for there is much injustice in this place and it is a place where many young have been cast out of homes for honest complaints so that the deeds of bad parents are facilitated with the aid of cruel fools who offer aid to such parents. Some of these are escaping abuse and many of the older adults in this place are criminals. Then there are many who are not criminals who dwell with greater luxury while much seems to become unravelled every day to be placed back for the next day. Many in this city are mentally ill so that it is almost a norm, and many have incurred drug addictions. Now those who would do the work of the mountain men but are not them are not given a name because they have no people and are going in many directions in this way. What is wrong they seem to be holding together for some purpose but of these there are not many only there are others among them who are not with them in any way as if travellers passing through to be with some other group. So what is might be seen to be not, because those who hold together the wrong are there as the corrupt ones of those people that there is no other people but the turem and any other that would be seen is in fact made up of many things being a place of many people groups. Now if they are a place of many people groups than how do they, any of them, hold together wrong? For if any should have erred here than it was because of something else that they have been more capable and yet the error is from something else that is not explained that if he has been honest than I think he has not, but if he has stumbled, I think he has not. But if he has only seen what is not than I think he has been more capable than is claimed. But the people are not but only some in this place are corrupt because there is only the turem and they have their land in the great mountain where their lodging is with windows hewed into the rock and gold and jewals and their homes are spread out amongst the pine forest in a mountainous place that they are an excellent people of wise skill and ability that is like that which causes good amazement for a small group of them are equal to a large group of others because they are like elite soldiers. Now some of them are warriors and in much of what they do they are a people of great ability being highly capable. Now those who would do any of their type of work are not a people but are like travellers passing through and of these only some are corrupt but the deception has been to some that there are more of them than there are who are corrupt. Now I leave any more to the turem because they are, I should think, capable of dealing with what they would.

As for the physical ethnicity in my time most people involved in matters of racism of any shade are not actually racist but are like non-warriors caught between armies that war and our city is caught in between and has no knowledge of why they fight and has no interest except that they should be able to continue daily life and commerce. But arrows go astray and come over the wall of the city and land in the stone platform between two citizens who are for being at peace with each other and there is chaos and what might seem like contention but it is only the arrows of the armies, of another. So some have looked from the hills and claimed that the city too is part of the war but it is not involved, though they claim it is. As for those in the armies that war they are the sacrifice, some have said, for the peace of the city that the citizens might be in peace with each other, but the armies are to be kept out because they are not permitted to enter the city or attack a citizen who is not in the war. For those soldiers who have attacked citizens of the city have changed their cause to the jelousy of the beauty of the citizen that it is changed for them and though they claim it is the war it is not because none of the citizens was attacking them. Now these soldiers who abandon the war to change their war to the jelousy of beauty of the citizen who is not in the war is one that the citizens should be protecting but dismay is there because the citizens are not soldiers and do not always fight because they are citizens of a city. Now such soldiers who become rogue deserve to die and some have been killed by the mighty soldiers who stay in the city to maintain the peace of all citizens of all shades. Thus there is sorrow and war in the land.

A person of hell is insolent when they speak as if fellow citizens with God’s to His people, because the enemies and war is known, and the hatred of those of hell is understood. For who kills children of God and then speaks peace as if not enemy soldiers? But let an arrow strike their throat and a knife placed into their mouth that the people of God’s do not have hate but it is known that the devil’s do even if they deny it.

Now there is a time when there is clear conflict that those joining sides with the enemy are wicked as them in the manner they are the devil’s that traitors are with them and the coals of their being then the enemy are on their head and sending up smoke, that they are entered below to the paths of the devil’s and they will not come back until they have paid many times the judgement for redemption when they have been kept with the enemy that the gate to the city is shut to them and swords are towards them if they would draw near to the kingdom again. For the seed was large in him and it was wicked, that never having been given the test the imposter was known and changed to the enemy as he always was. Now let his family go out to him and maintain Babylon for him because Babylon’s rewards are of the devil. But let in righteous trample him in battle and utterly kill him, and let the enemy bury his corpse, for he was the imposter who was always the enemy and when the clear test came it was confirmed and he was doomed to be with the enemy that he might not walk among us anymore.

The one insolent because they do not comprehend reality is wicked, because they fight with the enemy and believe they are fellow citizens with God’s and they are devices of the enemy and warriors of the enemy who are kept foolish to be effective in their efforts, and so it seems but in truth they comprehend all and they attempt to deceive because in truth all comprehend and perceive what is true and so they are sometimes attempting to deceive, and these are other insolent weapons of the enemy. For the devil uses insolence, disorder, chaos, like weapons against God’s people, and he uses wickedness, perversities sexually, perversities of judgement and condemnation, and perversities of every good thing, and he uses desecration of what is sacred, foolishness, strangeness, and unjust acts of perverted strength, and he uses foolish disruptions, attempts to hault, and attempts to cause to stumble, that he uses all that is disgusting to God and dispicable to those who are God’s. Now is he attempting to cause people to sin or to even become insane? But I would laugh if it was not very serious, for of course he is and that does not even have to be stated. For you are children of light, holy people, and when war is upon you I wish greatly for you to prevail.

For war is on the city and those of the enemy are dressed as us to attack while we fight, revealed to those who fight and the citizens of that place. For they masquerade as fair judges of soldiers while they fight, as if they were our citizens in peace time, to speak with obnoxious judgements that favour the enemy and are placing them on the enemies side. But a fellow citizen would judge in your favour because you have the truth of God. And a fellow citizen would defend you against their own child if their child was among the enemy, that they might be just. But one is the weapon of the enemy and why would they stop the weapon because the weapon and them are both the enemy and neither are fellow citizens with you but both have hated you with intensity, although the one who does not stop the weapon feigns arragance and indifference to mock you and speak cruelty and show cruelty against you when they are satisfied with the deeds of the weapon and that their hatred is being fullfilled although they do this as a participation with the weapon and as the enemy who is below and of the devil’s. For an entire family is the devil’s and one masqurauds as a fellow citizen with you but they are with the enemy that they might aid the enemy in war, for if they should portray themselves as a blameless judge who is to be fair they are being obnoxious in the perverse words they speak and mocking. For it is war, and let their corpses be thrown outside the city for none of them are citizens with you.

Now soldiers of Babylon are being imposters among us and they are not permitted into the sacred city of white stone and silver and wood, that the wall is high and the gates are shut, that while war wages, being declared likely enemies who are with the devil they have come in with great insolence to stomp like men who make a show of themselves, to confidently and arragantly ascend the steps amongst the holy guard, for insolence and wickedness is in their stomping feet that they disrespect the beauty of the city with their arragance, that they are walking as stiff necked men who heed no correction from God, and do not fear Him and they bypass the holy guards with strength that would heed no correction from God, indeed the rebuke and correction is in the air like a spirit and they stiffen their necks and they will not even blink for it. Now come to the throne because I have been joined by the precense of the one who commands me, being the son of God who endured for you and suffered and died for your sins, that he is well and not dead, but living, and I have heard to myself to understand that He is to have His enemies as His foot-stool. Now do not be afraid soldier of Babylon who are clothed in that of an iniquitious cult, for you are probably safe here, and your anger will be heard. But if you are not to be able to go out from the city the way you came in, than I am willing that you be considered to have been brave, for your king is already our enemy or it is not known but the life of you will be of more value considering your actions in this city than the lives of millions and of more value that acts that must happen that people might speak of peace. But show yourself a worthy man and you will live, but if wickedness is found in you than you will die. For are you not an enemy?

Now if the old Satan is teaching you foolishness from hate, than I would want you to have wisdom, that you not think I deceive or if you do you are not being commanded by me. But if any would be a virgin who is woman let them not hate themselves or hate themselves enough to be commiting hateful actions towards men. For a woman who hates herself is having enough of such hate to severe herself from the one who would be her husband with actions that demonstrate such and words. Now if she is hating herself for the purpose of virginity than what man can resent her? But the Christ will be husband of women who choose to maintain virginity for life. Now what if she is unable because the self is putting great control on her to maintain virginity? For she has desired to be as others. But if any woman has been fatherless than it is not good and if it has been the cause than there was not even a boy in child-good she admired. But if any stubbornness has seized her than has she been robbed of both? But let it be that she is not yet ready even if such control has still seized her. But if she is driving men away let her take the right path for she is not yet able.

Now the levels of a person’s actions are their type whether they speak and commit works spiritually or whether they speak and carry out deeds, that some are at different levels, and those who are for much action and they are evil are physical soldiers, that their evil deeds do not require much to bring them to it. Now the one who is of justice and is with the one whose level is of innocence of deed if not of mouth, that justice knows what the extent of patience is for them who are not as much of deed. Now the one who acts out wickedness and evil and do so as if sport with no reason of instigation as if they were not of comprehension but were like animals of impulse in what is required for them to do wickedness and evil, than these things are of hell, and they are clothed in hell-fire that laughs with perversity and folly and is fed with iniquity, and they are drenched with iniquity and if blood is there it is bloodshed, that these are things of hell that is beneath life that truth and justice might cleanse from the Earth because what is done on land must be cleansed on land and what is done inside can be cleansed inside that the body might not have to delt with, and it not being a matter for others to judge or know. Now what is done inside is not wrong only it can be wrong before God, that it is only for God to be able to judge or know. Now if any sins on land, that is upon the Earth of land, and they shed blood than the Jews have answered that the Earth is made well by shedding the blood of them who killed on land if it was murder. Now if unholy actions are speaking as if meddling in what is sacred do they not commit blasphamy and profane on land? Now those who will blaspheme and profane on land are beholden to the Earth of Land that they are being what is true among society and in their role for what they are, to be known for what they are. Now if they are to be wicked on the Earth of land and beholden to that world than let their hands not also follow after it, for the hands of such a rebel should be clean that he will be clean in a fashion, that he is not also of deeds with his hands and feet. Now if he is clean than it might be he is not the enemy but he does not wish to be among the holy ones, that if he does not commit that which is harassment truly than by what justice of God do you have right to harass him? But you know what is right and those who commit evil even in our name when we do not consent, when we are not with knowledge of it, are indeed our enemies.

Now if someone is insolent to an extent that they are as if ready to fight another because they have seen them and do not know them or of them, and they have seen the beauty of the person, that these are those who rebel and revile what is like a source of great misery for them which has ruined their life and robs them of much, that these are perceived by the soldiers to be possibly dangerous, but a beautiful person has known they do what is reasonable by truth and reality, for if a god is oppressing the peasant does he at least not have compassion and understand that it is a burden for them? But because the peasant has not been counted lucky in this fashion that they are not like a god than is any to blame him if he has resented the beautiful and even the Universe for his lot in life? But it is not seemly for princes to drink much wine, and what is not to be blamed in the ugly and miserable is for them who have much, to understand.

Now gods are of gods before a portion of men and women on Earth and goddesses of goddesses before a portion of women, that the ugly might not exhault themselves, being fit for beasts and insects to devour in a heap of what is disgusting, for a goddess is not an ugly person who wishes to descend to hell and cover themselves in blood and disgusting things to be lower than all, but a goddess is having her portion that a son who is a soldier and noble will be her husband and those she is a goddess to will bless her with truth and recieve good to their souls. For her maidens are like blessed sisters to her and concubines of blessing and truth for her, to be as maidens to her, and every costly thing is to be for her that she keeps herself a goddess with refusals and acceptance, being with wisdom, being more than a crown to her husband, for she offers a kingdom with it. Her father is not able to know for she has exceeding the role of a daughter many times over, that her god-hood is matained through excellence in morality and wisdom that her throne is established, unless she should become a mere person, having fallen from god-hood. But if it is not severe and God and righteousness will know, than a goddess might rise again to god-hood and she is capable of being a goddess by wisdom, that she admits and seeks truth and delivers good, being a blessed thing before righteousness. Now her younger brother has said that she is blessed, and she is chief among the daughters and administering what is good that they might be beautiful. Now if any is a daughter treated unfairly by her than it is because the goddess is not worthy of the princess. Now a god is having those drawn to him with great desire of heart to give him good, that it is right to do so, that none she be denied, for let what is for them be for them that truth might be fullfilled, for if a man is not one of these does he truly think himself better than those who would have great contention to give offerings to a god? But such are not sacrifices of worship, except that they are completions in deed of what is good. For some have eyes to know the precense of a god. Now if any says worship me they are below the feet of men and not a god, and if any has said, I am, than it is not a god who speaks it unless it be with good humour. But if any is trying to dominate, being a man, he is a dog kicked for being clumsy and in the way of those attempting to live their lives. Now a god will crush all these with good that is pleasing that their tears and agony might be the sound of good when he has ground what is low beneath his feet, that men too might stomp on them and crush them, that it is well, and a good and pleasing thing. So his sceptre is silver and weighty and it has much might and power that it brings good tidings and peace to those who do well, that Benjamin, a Jew, has blessed him, that the land is made with good tidings for him, that Joseph has blessed him but his way is still in other places. Now let Avram embrace me for this for I desire that he should have joy, that he is greater than all of them, and I desire for him to see the people I give wisdom to, that he might have joy.

Now a rich dog is not better than a lion for though a mangy dog is garbed in riches and though he dwells among what seems jewals and gold the jewals are made dross by his dog-hood and the gold is made tin and his horses made like wagons covered with hay and refuse with broken parts, that his crown is caved in and not, and broken pieces hang upon his head, and where it was there is coarse metal that is brittle and packed hard, that with the riches are cracks of iniquity and his bones are rotten and his shoes heavy and worthless. For a turem hath shouted, who is like the rich man! And he has saluted him, a dog with ugly riches, and if the lion is better, being strong and mighty than so the god is exceedingly better than him. For the lion is far from him in greatness and the god can hardly regard him in his lack of worth, for a dog skips and moves about the feet of those who greet each other. Now what worth has wretched Babylon and the cults of the devil that they attempt to make their ignorance that is of their cults part of the truth? But if one is great in truth and the material is added for much of what they have than indeed these things are bringing honour and glory and not showing them as a thing that shows them disgrace and disgusting, and garbs them in what is shameful, for it is not seemly to put a jewal in the snout of a swine and Babylon is wretched and low, a disgusting thing that sinks into mud, to be purified and ground up—but what can even be enough to be done to it? Wretched lie and ignorance is Babylon and all your priests are disgusting and absurd fools. You harbour even the devil, the old Satan, and he bends you to his will and you obey. You are drunk with blood, with decrepit oldness and uglieness due to your actions that defile you, that you are like an old and wretched thing weighed down with condemnation and guilt for the blood of the righteous by which you are drunk. For the devil is the puppet master who bends and turns you to what he wants and you are placing confidence and trust in him who would will that you suffer forever in hell.

Ahab was king and with every encroachment he made against the Christ he became lower so that by the end Jezebel ruled over him and before those pleasing God he was a servant. Now let the servant be treated like a servant and let them pile up what a servant cannot have for his body was destroyed and he was given labour and he had no wife anymore unless it was Jezebel who ruled over him and because he was not a Babylonian he did these things that he might perceive truth and be worthy of death. Now if the Christ was pushed and attacked by Ahab than how is it that Jezebel refrained from it? Now if Jezebel is to perish than let a new return from destruction because she refrained from pursuing the Christ, that the new might support him. Now if the Christ does not accept Ahab as a servant than let him do right and be destroyed that he might repent as a man and be killed that he might inherit the kingdom. For the those who supported Ahab and he submitted to them, are for judgement when it comes and the servants of Ahab are moving towards the place of a great prophet. Now women will mourn over them, and if blood is spilt than the Lord knows what is good. For a foolish people will not fear God, and if they send their priests than they are being sent before a great prophet. For their sons will die and they will be like those who would follow them to the grave. Their companions will suffer illness and perish before their eyes because they lift up their eyes to God with hope and consider themselves righteous. So God will strip them of order and riches and security that those they have been strong with will perish before their eyes because of the Lord. Still will their hearts be stubborn? But some will be cast out of Babylon to beg because a righteous land has been made Babylon, that a plague will take lives because of their continued stubborness in which they do not repent. So the women who have done wrong will lose brothers and they will come to shame who were brothers to them. Now will God win against humanity? But I keep myself from rejoicing except I am like one going out to do battle with him. Yet I have stopped in the grass upon a hill for He has said to me and kissed me on the forehead, look at what your father will do to the enemy army that I go to war with. And the son of God is standing taller than me and is there, being pure. Now I have said to myself let not any of them pity you who are to be the enemy because they have been charged to care for the child and none would go and save him, for they were stubborn and their hearts were not in it, indeed they could not care for the child to save him. Now if a true gentile should say it than let their son be killed and them as well for they commit blasphamy over the kingdom. For the Earth is to be made void of people except a small remnant because of one who was in the kingdom, that they said let us allow the child to be killed that we might inherit.

Now a dog boasts of God, and I drove them who were dogs away, because the people of the kingdom were gathered. Now the dog is boasting and quoting scripture but he is not in the kingdom and yet he is commiting blasphamy. For he honours God as a sinner and he is not in the kingdom and commits blasphamy. He honours God when when gathered with others, but he does not refuse to pray, and he is not in the kingdom. For he is called neither hot nor cold and is thus a Babylonian who is not in the kingdom and commits blasphamy. For one will be taken and the rest remain. One is God’s and the others have rejected them. For they have been jelous and envious and have rejected.

Now the Pharisees killed the Christ and Rome only permitted it that those who killed the Baptist refrained from doing it, so that they can then be repenting and be saved. Now if they are supporting the Christ and all of Rome was, than it is also true that all the kingdoms of history have supported Him and all their inhabitants. Now if all have supported the Christ up to this time, than Babylon is coming and is that it is bent and turned by the devil and that the devil’s cults are there and the kingdom of heaven has its many people groups, being the races of the kingdom that are of any shade, that are also dwelling at the time of Babylon. Now I wish for the kingdom of heaven to be utterly separated from Babylon because they are more of a problem for the kingdom of heaven when we are not seperate and I do not wish for Babylon to have any protection because the righteous dwell within it. But let God show which society is better that Babylon will be without the righteous and the kingdom of heaven without the Babylonian. For let their fools exhault themselves and pay respect to the devil, and if it be permitted, safe then, let us stand far back from what might be laid there. But a foolish people might repent and I have hope that most are not foolish that they will read and understand and repent. For I selfishly obey at times because of the reward from God, to be commanded by the Christ. Now because of the continuation of God with the Jews those who are upset and wishing to be apart of something bigger than them, molding themselves to what they are not in their paths to fight for another cause that is not the people of the kingdom but some other people who claim it but are wishing to rid it of the Jews who pursue the cult they have formed that is of what they consider to be better and pure so that the Elsnon are not these and they are of this cult in heart that they would afflict the Jews and attempt to drive them out, that it is a matter of firm conviction and confidence for them and they deny morality where Jews are concerned because nothing is immoral to them in that case. Now they say in many ways that the Jews are wrong for even existing and act and speak as such that they are clung to another culture and ideal that their country might have fought for they believe in a religious way of spiritual belief that they should be rid of the Jews. Now they do not claim Abraham as their predecessor and they are pursuing an ideal but are indignant to the presence of Jews in their society. When they speak of Jesus it is void, being empty, because their loyalty is more to their own history. Now if the Christ would have them they must not be as Jacob’s elder brother who did not regard his blessing but they must be fully comprehending what the Earth is. Now if they claim Christianity but resent it than do they only speak void intentionally? But if they would speak so than they are honouring some other cult and what they will do, repent or not, I do not know.

But if Babylonians are honouring God and the Christ know that due to their not being Christians or Jews, for they have not followed either, they commit profanity because their actions in not being Christians has made their honouring void and a profanity where it would have been better if they refused to honour unless they were saying I am not a Christian but have need of Him who died for me that I might not perish. For treating it so is not respectful to God and the one who says they believe in nothing had refused to prey, not being a fool, and has refused to honour Him, not being a fool, and you have said, the Babylonians who commit profanity are with us? But when you are in Heaven than I am desiring much that the truth of more be known to you when it is revealed by Him, that you might have greater understanding only I am satisfied with what I give you on this matter. For is anything only sport and does not all have great weight and consequence? For the one who is taking serious things seriously has claimed that these things can be the cause of wars and it is like a metephorical proverb in their mouths. For a fool has said in their heart there is no right and wrong and so I will not attack those who are better than Babylonians. But if any is one who says they believe nothing and yet they are a Babylonian they are a member of some cult of the devil, and it is not presently claimed what they are part of due to the blindness with which they attribute the cult to being something of innocence as if a thing like being a banker or dentist. But those not part of any cult and saying they believe nothing are not those of Babylon and they take what is serious to be serious.

Now I give no ground against what rebels against God, but what is easier to say, that you are attacking because of the devil who is your lord or that if you do so for what you claim it would be pointless. But if they are saying we have right to be ignorant and so do our people than allow them to be ignorant although the truth will remain and wisdom remains. Now if they say the ignorance is of our people and what we are that permit it that they might be their people. For we are not judging more but less, because of the knowledge that we judge sin and not the one who is permitted when they do not attack us, which is attacking God. Now if any says they attack us when in truth they do not, than are they with us? But the devil is doing evil in our name? Now if their schools of learning are providing a blanket for ignorance is it not for protection that they offer this thing like a protective action? For if they are not willing they are permitted to be their own people and why will any attempt to force truth in a way that does evil? But truth heard by the evil did not go into them and they only did evil with the truth not changing from their evil. Now those who do so with great aggression to attack those who are permitted their freedoms are not Elsnon, because why would good attack good? But the Elsnon are not a simple people, not being for arragance in the idea of doing evil. For the Elsnon have the Christ and the turem have their portion with the angels, that an angel was giving the Elsnon wisdom and the turem were dwelling with the angel. Now I am wanting for God to look and be pleased as He looked upon those at the Tower of Babel and was pleased because of what they accomplished so early, at such a young age. For these are—if I might not die I will cling to the one who commands me—but these are yours, the Lord,  these being also the Christs.

Now the one who takes serious things seriously has said, I am not your device to be used as a weapon when you have with-held knowledge so that if you ever use me in that way I will be back for you because justice has demanded it. But before this happens reveal more and all and be fearing God because I am in these matters answering to God directly and no person, that if you are having cause I will repent, but if you are the devil’s I will know by the truth that is in me that the judgement of God’s man is with God, and it is not with him who is not God’s for he will be wicked to you and chaotic in many directions, because he reasons selfishly that he is not concerned for any but has pretended that he might perceive that some did not know he pretended. But of those who take serious what is serious even the wicked of hard criminals who are being more respectful in this way. But as for those who wine and display that they are Luke-warm and without fear of God they are children deprived of wisdom by their fathers and they are cast into Luke-warm folly as if it were a people group that they have been done this to and not knowing and not choosing it. Now if a child is not prepared by their father and then cast into the wilderness what is it? But pity is for them.

Now that horse was called spoiled by the rich men who passed by for it received training, correction, and it is in splendid now, but the other animals were cast out because they were clumsy and sick and indeed they were neglected by the owner that they became sick and worthless for anything. Now praise is for the spoiled horse who is like a thing to be admired even by men, for even the horse is rich in his house, they have said, and we do not even want the animals who are sick and clumsy. Now if such is for a horse than do you not, being evil, love your children to give just and good discipline? But the horse of the rich man is more excellent than the peasant. 

For the father when being wise, when investing in something has gone out into his garden to trim and do well for the plant that is beautiful, that he gives to the world as a gift, for he has nurtured the plant, has not smothered it or neglected it, has stood back to allow it to grow has moved in to keep away the beasts that would maul it, has corrected it where needed, has offered it to what is right, has fretted over it and worried over it and has even asked God concerning it, that Abraham is He in this, and he has even worked for himself and given it a portion, and it is a prize in his house for the guests to see, because of its beauty, and he has even given it special places and invited them to see and he has adorned his house with good things and precious stones and said none is better than the plant I nurture, for it even reigns over the other things that are good. Now let the angels see, grab them with righteousness by the garment and force them to see the plant, for their business must cease for it. Now who is described? But surely this is a rich man. Now if a rich man being wise does this than let the light of splendour blind the people, and let those who are in darkness repent of foolishness. 

Now who is this who is sane when they are not considered ill of mind. But those who do this attempt to bludgeon and hit with heavy rods, that they will have the consequenes of what they do. For if they say, but there is not really God, and he does not judge, is it because they do not judge as him, that they cannot be judged by him? But they use the judgement and condemnation of the lie, being the judgement and condemnation of the devil, for he does not use truth as his weapons less they strike him when he fires an arrow. But if they have used the devil’s judgement and condemnation against the one who is for truth, who is God’s and above than are they not judged as they would judge and not condemned as they condemn. But if the weapons of the devil are being found used by a person than do not attain weapons from the devil and say they are God’s people who use the enemies weapons? Now the Elsnon are not a simple people, and they have the Christ and the turem have their portion with the angels.

Now if the devil uses truth unjustly as a weapon he uses lies-pride that is joined by the hyphen and is called rillet being an evil spirit that is used by the devil, for it attacks truth because it uses truth as an excuse, not being with any truth but using truth as excuse when the injustice brings forth rillet to be used as a weapon. Now justice declares there is not excuse for rebuke or correction because a person must be able to live with an acceptable level of liberty and it is so. So rillet is used against the just and the cat of nine tails was used against Jesus, who was a man, and the Christ.

Now a plague happened and the servants of the devil were fueled by evil to whip the people with rillet while the plague occurred and the king said let them be whipped with rillet, and I will force their shops to be closed but a few will be spared and let it be that they lose their livielyhoods by which they eat and let it be that many of them be forced out of their homes and onto the street. So it happened as the king carried out. Now the king protected many of those who were provided by the government by giving them more money that they might live, and he provided much medicine that the people might not die from the plague and many lived because of it. Now the value of the shekel became less and he provided for those who were sick in other ways, not from the plague, that they might live, and a rowdy tribe formed and marched to the capital and began to whip the people, some of them, with rillet to retaliate against the king. Now the king had allowed them for many days and when a time had passed he passed laws concerning their type and bid his servants to drive them out and so they did. Now in these days the angel was among the people in a city where there were many poor and much crime and part of it was like Sodom and Egypt and part of it like an oasis and the angel departed from Sodom and Egypt and dwelt close to some of the sick where it was better, and there were poor who passed though that area and there were also rich but not greatly rich. Now the rich had been those who were good to the angel who were not the rich of Babylon for Babylon might attack the rich if they are not loyal to Babylon and do work and commerce with Babylonians. Now even criminals who were serious about serious things did well concerning the angel, and some who were fools among criminals hated the angel. Now in sodom and Egypt the angel had been friends with prostitutes and those richer gave him many things. Now after the desert of loneliness where the angel ate the dust of affliction he was given a time among the sick before he went out from the sick to be in sodom and Egypt for a time. Now the angel said, I will neglect learning for a time to give wisdom, for God is better than Babylon, and it was so. Now the angel was even taking money set aside by the government for the creation of art and yet the giving of wisdom was not this. Now the turem man was good to him and if any was to revile the angel thought, they will be the words of ignorance, arguments with oneself that have been hurled in rebellion, being straw men of lies in their mouth and every impotent reviling that does not seek discussion, but is the more verbal growling and barking of beasts that know language, and they will show themselves mocking and saying ignorance with sarcasm to those who do not know it is ignorance, and such will be their people who have this substance within them, and they will seek to recruit other people who are not as them. For these are made with riches of ignorance and reviling and mocking and yet if they have righteousness and strength they cast away the knowledge of truth to be their own people still who do not want such truth. So if they do not want, then let it be, and those wanting reward let them know the truth if they want it. Now acts of extremism find a way because the deeds are already in them to be performed that any conduit will do for them. Now because of this the devil has swayed some of them to do acts for a cause which the devil has chosen. But a person who acts out deeds towards others and the deeds being wrong and for foolish reasons and not due to illness of mind are those who are carrying out acts of extremism. Now the one not capable of murder is attempting to murder by that means they are capable of, and when it is so they are capable. But the one not capable has said my guilt will not see it and God does not know of it, and yet they are capable. For these will not use a sword but they will use a bomb because they do not see the explosion that kills. For some are with pride, being ugly and idealizing Jezebel because of the uglieness, and idealizing wickedness because of their service to the devil, because they are ugly, that they would want to be great in the house of the devil, the house of hell, and all those in God’s house are superior to them who are ugly. So they have swelled with substance of wickedness to be great in the devil’s house to say, I am a great person for I am great destroyer, a great figure, because I have murdered many who innocent, a great thing to fear, because I am repulsive to God’s, a great strategist because I have slandered much and lied, a very clever person because I have stolen much, a great object of desire because I have commited adultry, a great power because I possess much hate, a figure of glory because children have feared me and I have been wicked regarding them, for if God’s loathe me, I am greatly to be feared, for I have not despised the pedophile anymore but he who kills children is my close companion and loyal to me as I am loyal to him, for those who slay children, who commit rape, who destroy those who are good are to be trusted, and I am not the Lord’s.

Now for those of the devil’s, why would the house of God owe you anything? But you are advancing your ignorance towards the city where there is truth, and you are the enemy, for you seek to kill all of the city and are only owed a sword to the throat or an arrow to the abdomen. 

Now arguments are then so foolish as to be harrassment and nothing more that there can be no talks but the talks come later. Now if you are only receiving harrassment than there is nothing for argument and if such is the case than no anger will make it coherent and bring it to order for if a rabbit has been disturbed you pass it by, being good, and when a gazelle is frozen you do not throw a stone, being good, for let understanding know truth when such is due to what is not war, but where there is visciousness in strength and inclination to violence towards you than you deal with a raging and charging beast so that the one is not the other. For strong man of understanding, of might, and of wisdom, you are given wisdom to confirm some things that talk can happen later when there are those ready for peace, that not all is lost, and there is hope still for what you would accomplish.

Now when things are very bad good people keep trying to live in peace while bad people keep conspiring to go to war against the good, because they have no reward, being made poor by the cults of the devil, being war-like because they have nothing to live in peace with. Now these bad people are those of the devil’s and they are continously being robbed of what is better, and they are given things of little worth by the devil, mere bags of metal that make noise. For their gold becomes tin and there is a bitter lead in their mouth, and their silver becomes dross and they are empty of what is good and of God. For if they had a head start on the war they are miserable to say you have been imprudent in not preparing for war and the wickedness of us has proved your foolishness, which their heart speaks in tears of desperation because they are being faithfully judged and punished by God, so that it has been proved to them infinity times, their punishments being frequent and the dispossessions being complete, that they have only once for the hundreds attacked you for the hundreds God has acted against them and it has been in fact proven to them their foolishness thousands of times so that their hearts weeps with desperation, for they are massacred daily and know they do not do now what will not be to your credit with God, because it is terrible for them and God throws away all from them and they are weeping and in anger that they should have even one thing to claim they have something good for themselves, so that compassion you should have, for your neighbour Babylon falls down and weeps in your precense for you have everything and they have nothing and thus it has been and it continues this way because of God, powerful and mighty who is faithful to judge and faithful to reward, so that they, some of them, are weeping and nashing their teeth and are thrown out into utter darkness and poverty that they might wallow in misery and even sometimes envy that, let them say at least that they have one victory against you, and have pity on them. But if it is not right and the circumstance is different than it is right for you to speak the truth that they do foolishly and are not accomplishing what is not nothing.

Now arguments are then so foolish as to be harrassment and nothing more that there can be no talks but the talks come later. Now if you are only receiving harrassment than there is nothing for argument and if such is the case than no anger will make it coherent and bring it to order for if a rabbit has been disturbed you pass it by, being good, and when a gazelle is frozen you do not throw a stone, being good, for let understanding know truth when such is due to what is not war, but where there is visciousness in strength and inclination to violence towards you than you deal with a raging one so that the one is not the other.

Now you are not a simple people, but if any would strong-arm you to say you must fight for us because of some moral cause and yet it is not in truth the circumstance of the cause and if those who would say you must fight for us are actually in the case those who want to destroy you, than are you to fight for them or meddle. But how much the hate of these that will prey on the pure with such trechory and deception and it seeks the persons life? But you are to be among those who would be like real brothers to you who will not be of such falling from righteousness to exercise such wickedness. For the subtlety of the wise is entirely different to the subtlety of wickedness because the former excels it like light excels darkness. But the later is wickedness of a type and is of the devil and it is perverse and hates all that is good and right and of God for the devil’s have promoted their own house and being the devil’s they have attempted to judge God’s people with the devil’s judgements being what is in their heart, the devil’s house and it’s justice and judgements that are beneath and in hell. But God created the Universe and the old Satan, the devil, he also created, and the enemy is for hell.

But let the civilians of every shade, all be Elsnon, stay out of their war so that they are not able to turn any against the other and sow discord. But if they fire even that flaming mass from a catipult over our wall let none be injured and aid our own and let not the shouts and attempts from outside the gate cause discord between us for we are Elsnon. Now if one is a god or something else let it not be counted as wrong that he is so, but there are different types in our society and not all are brothers and sisters, and yet we are Elsnon and civilians to the war they wage. For the rich of the good lands are even capable of being among you, not being Babylonians and the lacking that they are, but being doers of what is wise and performers of what is wise that they are for being with good tidings and the behaviour of what goes well, and yet outside those doing war are fighting with what we do not know and cannot know for they attempt to pull us into their conflicts at times that civilians might die, and which sides hate the city we do not know. But the gate is strong and yet enemies break in and walk among us clothed like us and portraying themselves at first to be one of us, and yet their evil shows they are of the soldiers who fight outside the walls that they might fight some of us and sow discord to draw us into the war. Now seperate and fight their wars and we will be destroyed because they cannot war with us as they would like because of the city walls. But even Babylon defends us in this thing although their soldiers are often slow to bring aid of combat, and yet their army is mightier than all of those who wage war around us. For their mighty men are of great ability and their spies are for us if they will not be traitors. For the mighty men of Babylon are from a city not Babylon and it’s corruption, and they are not fighting yet for any corrupt thing of Babylon.

Now the mouth of any in your city that says to another I am better or superior to you is speaking a lie because such is found in the mouths of very young children and in those older it is the truth of one who is base with wickedness, that they are not of a heart to be one of the people, but they are resenting all the people and are there as an enemy and to sow discord between the Elsnon. Now let them depart that wickedness not spread and continue for if they came new they came with the heart of an enemy to deceive and betray trust. But let there be no knowledge of any shade in this matter unless you should degrade into inequalities of base and physical things of Ria. But let it not also be so as not to sow discord. For the wicked who do this come like a splinter that ripples out and says I will only swallow the one you are jelous of, that I will rid you of your need for righteousness that more might fall to wickedness and a curse be upon your people. But if another should say, I am superior to you, he has spoken from the heart a lie that is the opposite of truth that he has indeed praised the other because the lie could not stay in to proclaim the truth that it could not be contained. Now this is a spiritual truth that is of Mala that the truth must escape some and the opposite will be said by the spirit because the opposite says ‘much’ to what was said, giving more amount to what was said. Now is there not still injustice? But if one is so lower than the other than the people should not, for the kingdom’s sake, fail to acknowledge what the truth is when they know it. Now if any should treat such things like a game because of the knowledge they have been given, that this is low and dispicable you having understanding in all things know the truth no matter what has occurred or been said in any circumstance that you consider.

Now if the fig tree does not have fruit when I come, than I will leave it to God, because Avram prepared a meal and inquired, Abraham, and if these do not regard what Jacob did than I will judge that they are an unworthy people. For they say, the work was all done by our anscestors to do well and we need not do anything good anymore, for we are Christians, a chosen people, and what we do will be right because none will be with their foot on the Earth and we inherit all by history. Now who is watching? But if any is watching what do they look for? But if any has entertained angels without their knowing than surely those who are rich will do right when they read the signs, for they are able to read the signs. But if any can read the signs I will want for God to place a mark over their door, and if any is doing for the one who commands me than what am I to say to Him who commands me? But if they are cold I believe it will be better for them than Luke-warm because the foolishness of neither hot nor cold has been insolent and ignorant of truth, for it does not take serious what is serious. But if any is wicked and turning their back to me rather than cold, then I have already had judgement concerning them. But if Babylon has made the Earth poor and Luke-warm than I will give a blessing to Avram and to the Jews both. But if there are any Christians who are reading the signs and watching I will desire for Jews to be with it and both having good.

Now three renegade kings have been on Earth against the Jews. The king with those of fair skin has been against them, the king with those who are Arabs and Persians, the king with those of a place with many gods. Now there are others. As for those of self hate who are ugly they are against humanity. Now which of these desires to preserve and does not act against any? Now which of these groups does not meddle? Now which does not destabilize a country? For the ones who partner with the devil have sought the lives of the anointed at times, and the Luke-warm is for turning their back when there is murder. Those who meddle have been encroaching and those who destabilize have cost much for a nation. Now Christians need the Jews to live and if the Christians should vanish than who is the king of Israel to be? But if the children of a father have produced children and children’s children than how many of these are with cults of the devil? Now what matches substance is acceptable and good and what does not causes the heart to tumble and turn. But if any is hating themselves and with self pity than the truth of reason is not of value to them in what they do. Now if the heart tumbles and turns at what only is, than what manner of heart does a person have? Now what is sweat as honey and yet makes the stomach sick? But if any is for truth than let them read. Now if any is watching than they are comparible to a tree that had fruit when the Christ came, and you have been told that he is coming again. Now what miracle will God perform for you that you might believe? But if Mala and Ria are one than will you not know? Now if your children are prophesying will you not know? But if you are watching you may also know that a belief in God is reasonable.

Now is the upcry from those calling themselves the Christ’s being true? For I must see for myself when the time will come. Now is it as insolent as I have heard? But if they are luke-warm and so insolent than they are sodomites in the concealment of saints, for they would have been less insolent if they were cold. But not taking serious things seriously they mock God and say, we have no need of signs and we do not need to watch. What is more we have no need of God. Now let Rome crucify you and we will deliver you to them and we have no need. Now if low cursing is in their hearts than they are dispising the good and returning evil. For their leader is a Pharisee and he thinks in his heart he deceives the faithful ones in his flock as if they were foolish, despising them, and his brothers are those among the flock who do not watch.

The first is lack of consideration (little blame). The second is personal problem (escalation but no blame or little or much). The third is weapons fired (terrorism and warfare). Now the truth is clearly perceived by those who are given the sword to bear. Now the Christian who is a rebel towards the nation is saying they know better and we have God and they have nothing and this is not the separation from Babylon that is good. For the Christian who is a rebel in this fashion is like a rogue wilderness tribe that is unruly. For they disregard the protections provided to the saints that are with the king and pass alongside those things of Babylon and are not tarnished by them. For such good is at times with the king or queen and it is from God. Now let not the rogue rebel claim they do not rebel against God in the wickedness they do against the Christian for in this they also rebel against God when they do wickedness to the Christian. Now if a gentile speaks thus being king than he is over the devil and under the feet of the Christians that they might trample him in mud and his throat is cut by his lowness. For if Joshua has placed his foot on the neck of any king than you will not claim God unless you have passed through the eye of the needle. But honour the king as it is well, for if you are a true offendor than is not the judgement from the Lord? But if you are a rebel and rogue do not believe your death unjust.

Now my commander they have not believed in me and so perhaps they believe in you. For they have cut me off and harassed and behaved like a crowd of the angry and violent from a place outside the wall while I was inside the wall. Their noise and sound continues so that as I attempt to do your work they rattle the gate and shout and attempt to meddle in speech in ways meant to disrupt. Now these are those claiming they do not believe in me and I have not asked them to. Now I am still of some compassion for them, although I come to you to give you knowledge of it that you might know whether it is true or not and what should be the right thing. For they are seeming increasingly for war and attempt to in speech seperate me from you, and yet I have claimed they are not to worship me and what I give to others they are disrupting from outside the walls. Now who these are I cannot say, whether Christian or not, and they are behaving with speech meant to disrupt like tactics of war and soldiers.

Now these seem like weapons: those who do not understand the boundaries of language in discussion who seem aggressive without comprehension of delays and assumptions built into the language, those who are overly addicted to comfort so that they speak against all that would touch them, those who dismiss objective truth when stated with anything that cannot dismiss it because nothing can, those who offer what changes nothing and those who do this and continue on the basis of it with their ears shut and necks stiff. Now if any is found with all of these they are like an angry man of war in combat who uses knives and breaks bones and strikes with fists and regards nothing save for combat and hears no words but engages in combat. For such is a fierce warrior of ability who is praised in war and he is not to be reckoned with. Now if any is doing more than this to argue with themselves within themselves and the speak as if the other had said it and to speak that which is only meant to be phrases of disrespect to insult than they are like a blood-thirsty soldier who is in a frenzy of massacre to kill and massacre wherever they can. Now if any judges and condemns the one defending themselves these are like a partner in homicide and like those of the devil covered in blood. Now if the two are partnered they are together forever, and partnered and bound together by the devil in stubborness for they are the devil’s son’s and daughters, those of his own house who walk and eat of the fruit that is in it. For around such a house is hell-fire and the glow of blood is as a spirit in the air that they are with iniquity and blood-shed, brother and sister of incest and in the devil’s house.

Now the cult of the devil is in the mouth’s of the devil’s and they say you are to obey the devil’s cult because we have placed it in the world and called it an addition to morality. Therefore God has commanded you to defeat the devil and his soldiers and to live and so they have said, obey the cult of the devil and let me kill you, and speak lies and do not fight back and promote my lies that I will have substance of ignorance, claiming things I have not performed so that I might claim without substance, so that you will promote me in having what I do not, giving me ignorance for substance that will give me that strength of the devil, and lieing with you mouth that you might disobey God and compromise your righteousness, for I am not your brother, your sister, or your wife, and to believe so does not know truth, that I am for hell and am the devil’s and I take others with me if I can and do war as a soldier of the devil.

So it will be said that a jack-ass generation came forth and those things that other generations would do to live and pleased God and were given for them to do, the jack-ass generation found to be disrespectful to them so that they were to kill all the inhabitants of the planet, being the great monster that came forth to obliterate all the inhabitants of the Earth.

Now to all the future: if a generation comes forth to kill all their children you are commanded to live. I give you this command without a command from any. 

Now a sociopath is not required to repent for they do nothing wrong, for they are fools. But they indeed have need to repent. Now the one who says to God, My brother is dead and I do not know how, is not one who has repented. Now those who would trick God are tricked and deceived, and those preserved for judgement continuing in a thing. Now those testing God fullfilling less and those fullfilling worthy to give. Now if any would buy blessing than they purchase from God because if none sells their blessing they fullfill that they are to be counted as such. For if one fulfills less and by choice than he is given reward for what he fullfilled, but the one shutting their hand and with money has nothing. Now if selfishness is inclined to less than for what reason do those of Babylon know surprise because of the little they have? But they fullfill not towards God that they would fullfill to others and not to others that they would fullfill unto God. But if any is watching than do they not have the reward of Heaven? But if I would restore a Tower of Babel and they have used the name in a foolish and base way to become a by-word of racists, than I am not he who built it, but let me build it, that if it should do well and be pleasing than such a tower will please God.

Now the strange and confusing rituals and actions of the pedophile are a perverse marvel of strange confusion to those who are not of them. Now with tentative nature they commit wickedness and strange animal like wisdom is found in them that their low needs and requirements are understood among them, that they are animals and such is a knowledges among them, each to each. For the one had said, I am threatened and require to perform some act with my arms and legs, and the other, I am made afraid and must go to a place and behave some way. For they seem tentative at times, even nervous, but their low impulses pull at them in their hearts where animals convince each other and understand. I must dominate, he says and I go to fullfill my need for my guilt. I am I’ll another says and so I must intimidate. For they are strange beasts of cruelt even and uncertainty and they use medicines on humans and kidnap them and they slander, attempt to kill, and cry in wrath and even in self pity. For they have said, all our ways are wise and are prudent for the Ocean is our only lodging where we have been cast. Now their places are in Babylon as part of many of the devil’s cults, and they are worshiping in pride the desecration and destruction of others. For they walk in meekness at times and other times in ways of violence and strength that such is considered insolent for them, because what is beneath the Ocean is not men to men who dwell above the surface, if the cause of it is the molestation of children, but to other matters men are pardoning much and not judging as much, because God has placed the Ocean where it is and how it is. Now if these are cacooning being that they are iscolating themselves to be with their own type to become deaf to the rebuke of those outside the group and even blind to rebuke, than they speak with vague gestures about the killing of children and support each other with proclamations void of understanding. They have even spread ignorance among themselves with which they become confident and strong, for with some of them the hand must be confident to shed blood. Now if one of them is slayn than they require blood to pay for it, but one not of them is slayn they call it justice because they have said the child or adult, both being the same in the matter of death, sought my life and I have done no wrong, for the child or adult would slay me with truth and it is the same to murder me, by which them being killed is justice. For they have appealed not to morality, which is truth and reason, but they have appealed to a nihilism that is set aside for animals. For being under the Ocean they are a strange type of human not meant for the Ocean. For people they once were and yet their lungs still draw breath and they are hating those who would kill them and labelled them blood-thirsty slaughterers of the innocent.

Now a slayn child is better and by far greater than the one who molests children. For if the later should live a thousand years their life is void and their days pursued by righteousness, but the righteous are not pursued in this fashion.

Now the city in which we dwell is made of smooth white stone and silver and there is a wall and gates and there are steps that ascend to the palace chamber and holy guards towards the palace house, and there are plants and wood and the city is holy and pure and populated by the people of light, a holy people. Now the city is with the happenings of good life and good dwelling and those who reside there are for good.  The walls of the city are high and the gate is adorned and beautiful, though it is strong, for the city is such to defend against battle if needed. The pure and holy are there and the levels are not so many and the city not so large that it cannot be traversed by a swift person, but it is city, as for peace and even learning and aquiring, and those who are gathered there are pleased to be there, or so it seems to me, in my desire. But though any should squabble with violence and armies should war outside and even wage wars at the city the walls have been hindering much war efforts and if there are even stray arrows the people of light who are holy are with peace and wellness. For I have wanted peace for the city and I have desired to build a greater Babel to honour and please God as He seemed pleased with the first but to save lives scattered the people. Now let the city be filled with books of knowledge and scrolls of truth and let the places of study be for the people of light, the holy people. Now the brave ones are wise in this place and of much nobility and they are students for wisdom and understanding.

For being influenced and receiving what could been prophesy the one before has caused trouble for the kingdom, because as he did not know even more than I did not know, he has stumbled to a crooked way of revealing some of what is right with fiction, having a good in him to prophesy and has he fullfilled? But if the one who came could not fullfill it I have held him blameless, and I am not wanting him to diminish in any way for I do better with such a one alive and he still lives. But he is not my servant and though he comes prior to me he is also not my father. But he brings what he can and what he wanted that none might stumble because of him. Now has not another claimed, a human can deny any impulse but an animal cannot? But is it even good? But being a Christian as I gather him to be he seemed to have received knowledge and sight and perhaps by wisdom, for there is wisdom covering and coming with it, that he has percieved the people he is part of, being Christian. Now if any of the ugly are outside the walls to Nash their teeth and hurl discord than their sound is falling for now because a peace has fallen to dwell and I have loved the good of God. Now if any are worthy who would have the heart than I will be blessed by them, for if there is conflict than there can still be people to have good with. Now in Babel I strive because there is much to be done, but if Babel is to be built than the tower should be pure with Elsnon and with gods and goddesses and that the rich of the good lands might come and go, that what the devil turned I turn back to God, for it is His if it should please Him. Now if the cross is outside the tower and the three crosses and if there is a hill and flowers there and a ring with keys either steel or gold coloured than there is rope, too, attached to the cross, and even a tree that brings forth fruit being a full tree and a pool of water with a stream that runs into it, and a smaller tree that is small, as if insignificant by comparison. Now if I see the crosses empty in this place I do not know why. But if an angel stands with their sword and is arrayed with halos of light and wings I do not know, but the tree is having seductive fruit and the leaves are a rich texture. Now can I with wisdom know it or is a prophet required? But I am afraid to ask the one who commands me.

Now a silly fool of the devil has said, I have caught you doing wrong, but what was done was not wrong. Now a rediculous fool of the devil has said, you teach me morality that I might judge, but no one teaches them, and they are deceived. Now a person has sought to stalk as if to ambush, but a person of the devil’s has done so for what they are part of, being a cult of the devil’s to stalk and even attack God’s for the devil. For if the cults of Babylon are at war with God and His son than why would you not know that the devil’s will be at war with those of the kingdom? But if any is hating his wife because she is not his wife, than he is loyal to the devil and has no marriage with her. But if he views her as an enemy and him a soldier to destroy her he has viewed her neither beautiful or ugly but as one of the enemy he captured in war that he hates who he has brought to his house, for his wives are others, and he had said I will mock her and mistreat her as an enemy in loyalty to our kingdom of hell and the devil. Now who is for stoning this woman? But she is a captured woman in war and is she not right to escape? But let the wise descern if it is the case and if she is being rescued and agreeing let it be so.

Now God is honouring the ceremony of marriage and it is like a thing of heaven, being holy and pure, but where an enemy soldier has gone out to do wickedness like sport, to capture an enemy than in this case there is no marriage. Now if any comes to the ceromony with trechory than when it is discovered the other is blameless. But God knows what is acceptable for the ceremony and what is not. Now if any should come to mock it is zeolots (terrorists) even if they should seek to conceal their cause. For they are against God and what is good and they should be cast out, for if it is abomination understand that the devil has done wickedness in killing Abel. Now the ceromony is as a dome of a holy place that is pure, and so it is that it is a thing closer to heaven.

Now those who seek to mutilate and destroy and defile and desecrate what is pure are sicophants and there are pedophiles who are such, but I do not attribute this to anything that is not wrong, but acceptable, for that is another thing. Now you are not a simple people grasping at words and phrases and using them when there is what you do not know to use it where it does not apply, for you know the truth, and if you do not know, than you know what is right. Now I give no wisdom to be used for evil and so I am for speaking against the accusation where it does not have application in some thing and being without any wisdom I have given in those times to be to it as you would have been without any words from me.

Now if there is a phrase at this time that is a conduit it is based on false moral ground, and the phrase is the conduit by which evil is rationalized. Now in the place I am at the phrase is, they are believing they are better than us or me. Now any animal acts that are of the devil are rationalized with this phrase. But it is no other’s business to know or judge what another believes and even to believe such is not wrong. Now I call this phrase that is a conduit a bazdak and it is a spiritual device of the devil’s. 

Now the one who has doing charity to the poor man will know the very rare one that is the devil’s begger. For his works are all evil and he is as if poor and miserable that none should judge him because he is one making himself poor intentionally, being a very rare thing. Now if you do not know it, than why regard this thing or take this thing to knowledge seeing as it is good to have charity to the poor. But if the devil has placed even an imposter in this place of good, than you know that his wickedness is entire and complete. But if it is so than God has not matched the devil or the devil God but there are more things of God than of the devil’s to cover for it, that it is well and God’s things are exceeding. But it is good to fullfill righteousness and the Christ fullfilled though if you believe I fullfill all righteousness than you are wrong. But the portion with one thing is to God and the other to Babylon and they are not of Babylon. But have not the cult’s of the devil despised charity unless it is purified from good to be selfish? For the Babylonians purify good things from good that the thing might be clean to them by the standard of the devil’s cult. For God’s things are not all clean to them, and some have hated all the substance and good things of God that they might be clean according to the devil. Now if God’s people are capable of using money in a pure way according to God than the way is considered disgusting and impure to those of the devil’s cults. Now if God’s people would grow anundant with money and riches of God  to built great and rich kingdoms on Earth that are beautiful and filled with glory than so would Babylon and the devil build their kingdoms on Earth to be filled with the glory that is pure to them. Now if any has feared God to say, I fear to outmatch New Jerusuluem than I tell you to try but you will not outmatch eternal life or any of the power and holy creatures in that kingdom for let not the fear of God keep you from good, for He was pleased by Babel, because such fear should be with righteousness to even do God’s work against the fear of angels that you be doing good and be—if I might—good to angels for if you have this righteousness you might be capable of dwelling with angels. But if the amgels are dismayed with any and do good for them, than are they not a great people who are righteous and for whom the angel is to do good when they are dismayed by them? But I will rather dwell with their elders and the ones very wise and holy. Now if I am reminded by one of them of Avram, Abraham, than do I see that I am liking him in error? But I do not believe so. But I do not wish to be a burden if I proclaim to another people concerning this one, or to cause them trouble, for I wish that he will have honour on Earth.

But none ever claimed you could use philosophy in an argument. For we communicate with what we do, and there is a time and place for what is good.

Now if the zeolot defends the works of the enemy, the devil, against us, than you should know what they, the zeolot, are.

Now the one cries to say, I am so jelous that I cry for I did not know you people had learned to speak or even read, and this is meant as disrespect and bullying, for some of the devil’s will go this far. Now another has said, I am very pleased and so much so I am impressed because I did not know that your people could walk or tell when it is morning or afternoon, and this is meant to be disrespect that the person who does so might be despised. Now the later is mother to the former and they go their seperate ways to do their evil.

Now only insolence is offensive and arragance is not to men, but permit women what is acceptable in all things when you are knowing it is acceptable. Now what is in truth cannot be insolent and arragance without insolence cannot be judged by men.

Now the one who trembles for another’s safety and feigns great fear when another walks or lifts water that they might drink is a servant of the devil’s and though they use rillet and pervisity of righteousness they are a disgusting and wicked thing. For these attempt to frighten and make generally afraid that they might pervert concern to smother that they might attack what is God’s and does not the child sit on the hill and God, the father says, watch what I do in battle to the enemy? But let them scream in pain from hell and their agonies not be heard when the one they would abuse dwells in Paradise with the holy.

Now the devil perverts good things to make bad and disgusting things to be used as weapons. Kindness and concern he has perverted with inquiry to become Moldok, and he has perverted pride and deception (being like wind) with hate to make rillet, and judgement he has perverted with iniquity and mixed it with hate to make gungon and condemnation he has perverted with iniquity and wrath to make conhon and sexual harrassment he has used like a sharp weapon and a weapon that blungeons and cuts and perversities of self judgement he has perverted to be used for objects that bruise and blundgeon, called ticiton, and perversities of being pleased and impressed he has perverted with hate and wrath to be made into kolir. Now there are other weapons he has made and the devil’s people, becoming ugly in using these weapons, are having no great grievance with performing these conversions due to general hate and wrath.

Now there is the jelousy that is directed towards a man or woman and from either because it is a senseless jelousy that plagues a person, and the person is seized with stubborness by the arms and legs and shoulders that they cannot do right for another in some matter because they are seized hard and incapable. For their heart hath said would you have me tear ribs and bone with resistance? For I am not even mighty enough. Now they have that association with another that is not in truth, because they are not the sibling or friend and they do not dwell with them and have to see them daily and they associate that it is so on sight because their eyes are jelous and envious, and they associate such even by word of mouth that they are sick and seized with sickness. For a righteous man has said in loyalty you are a citizen who is for benifiting my country and my loyalty is strong and good. But with the one seized it is not so.


Now what ability and power are the turem given that they are capable of dwelling with angels, being people of the kingdom and comparible to a kingdom unto itself. For there place is with mountains and pine trees, grass and rocky terrain and many things of nature. If they could conceal the smoke they would, and their might is with an intelligence that surpasses that of any person of Babylon, for they are not Babylonian. Now the bridge over the great ravine that goes into the lands where there people are is one of many bridges and they are in good lands. Now Sodom and Egypt, is it worse than Sodom? But the Christ was killed in Sodom and Egypt. Now what is the name of good lands and what is the name the turem would call themselves if they choose other names. For I have called them the turem, and if any calls a place a name not suitable than is it to be mentioned? But if the turem are a great people than let not the enemy attack them and let us fight with them if they are still for being turem. But what more is there with the turem and how many secrets do they have of their people? For they are dwelling with the ability to go out into the land and patrol for their defence.

Now when the jelous older sister of Benjamin is not his sister, but a gentile, is it not a worthless one, and her father is ashamed or as worthless. For she is not worthy to speak to him, and does not perceive humanity, even people, for she is a thing of disgrace among her own people. Now it is right for her to face the tribunal of wrath that the gentiles not become gentiles again, as they would be, but that they are with God. For if Joseph goes another way, that his way might be in other places, so the people will keep him and his brother that it might go well for them. Now would the people abandon righteousness to become an eye-sore from on high? But those who promote are those promoting the wasting of riches and glory that the people might die.

Escalation is not foolish when wickedness becomes outrageous, because the land must be saved and the good inhabitants.

Strength by insolence is insanity, but the mighty are able to speak like people.

To remove any layer of context is an attack carried by insanity, but integrity is in the way of reason.

The context of words is often what makes them offensive or not offensive but the one who removes context is attacking with insanity.

Now a god or goddess is not a prince or queen that those who might wish two things that cannot be compared to be wrongly compared. But if any should take action to gain the favour of a prince than it is not something more or from that which is with the Elsnon, for why do you imagine what is not when there is no cause, or why should any ask for discussion when God did not consult with you concerning any prophet? But any who is a Pharisee, than allow them hate and bitterness, for they boast of Abraham when they are children of the devil, and why would any think that two things are the same? For if one is of Jacob than what is the other? But the things of the kingdom are not those of Jacob or else it would have been said. But if any is a prince among you than indeed some might seek his favour but those seeking favour are only doing that and nothing more and they do not come into the things I have mentioned. Now if some speak of the things of Jacob and others the things of the Elsnon than I would rather you know that you do not place a shoe on a hand and you do not place a hat on an elbow because you compare two things that cannot be compared. Now if any speaks to you in a language angels, do you know what they say? But if any can descern it, than is it not good? But if the prophet does not come to discuss than why would any when it is not a thing, even by you traditions, that are open to discussion? But if it is the giving of wisdom it is either rejected or not.

Is it easier to say gentile or Babylonian? But those of the kingdom are not gentiles and if they are not Jews than they place the truth of God before those low things of Babylon. For Babylon has kings due to luck and chance and its princes are those who did wrong to be placed there. Why then does any exhault Babylon over the truth? But truth, having all substance, is not luck and chance and if there is injustice it is known by God. But the prophet does not annoint the leaders of Babylon and the things that given in injustice and without merit are not the truth for they have no substance. Now if Babylonians should be jelous of any of those not Gentiles it is because they have no substance, being constructed and held by Baybolon and being of the merit of Babylon, which is nothing. Now if a dog should enter your house it is possible a grievance, but what dog is for exaulting itself over the child? But let them strive and mis-shape themselves according to Babylon that they might strive and bend and hold themselves up for nothing and no reason because they are animals before the child. But if men and women of the gentiles have feigned insanity to intimidate and bully than are they not a foolish and confusing people fit for the animals, and yet the animals are more noble than these. For even blasphamy by their cults is invented when it is and cast away at another time, that they are a rediculous and foolish people who boast and exhault themselves in nothing and do not possess the humility for truth. For if any should adhere to truth, that Babylon is luck and chance, they will not be at war with the kingdom, because the truth is not Babylon. But let not the unloved child believe that life is fair, suddenly, or the ugly one, that they are loved. But if any will know truth and believe that there is an afterlife than they know what is true. But if any will say, the fire will consume our sacrifice, then at length let them realize the consequences. 

Now the Jews are greater, more, and above the gentiles, and the Elsnon are not gentiles and if those of the kingdom are both a type and gentile and not a gentile at all, being born from any people, than you reason as Jew who has the wisdom to understand such things, and you reason correctly. Now if the souls of gentiles should perceive the Jew who had been born of any people than if they deal with evil it is only the reviling of them, that they are indignant and it is found hard to bear. For if gentiles are angry is it not against their own lives when it is at one born of any people? But if the invisible things of God should slay them in their anger is it not only expected? But if there are daughters who desire him who is a Jew from any people than are they not Jews as well? But in some cases it is so. But if gentiles are defending perverts and killers of children do they not do what is their inclination being merciful to hate justice? But is this the kingdom of heaven as if it were something to be from gentiles? But the New Testiment is connected to the Old Testiment and it is not honest to seperate them.

Now the use of iniquitous condemnation is not good for Christians, and those who would sacrifice children to false gods, is one who is gaining from hell what is ignorant. But if any would give bread and water in Christ’s name, is it not good? But those giving good things are to attain from God, when they do it in Christ’s name. Now if any commits some type of wicked violence towards another, even that type fools do not call violence, and do so in Christ’s name and even so in the name of Gentiles and against those who are with God than their way into the kingdom is blocked because they did so in Christ’s name. For this one is servant to them they did wickedness to and the way is granted by their master in this case. Now these are those who became servants because they attempted to trick God. Therefore do not do violence of any type to another in Christ’s name when it is wickedness. But if there is not war for a country it is not good to attempt to trick God, because Cain said to God that his brother had died, and he killed him because God did not like his sacrifice. For do not Babylonians have the same heart? But the one who attempts to trick God is deceived.

But if any type of soldier or anyone who is of the justice of Babylon believes their duty is to now be wicked and to condemn the righteous, these are servants of the devil and the devil is beneath your feet. But if they speak with wrath and anger they do of the devil, for they are his and faithfully obey, for being filled with his substance they seek to condemn even God and if they have attempted to condemn Him do they not attempt to condemn you? But they cannot be grafted to what is righteous and the righteousness of others does not connect them. So they have taken even their own will from the devil, being his servants, and they have a heart to zeolously do his will. But if a servant of the devil should seek to murder the innocent is it not because he becomes a man of the devil? But those who slay civilians do not fight in battle unless they have opposition of combat. But if any of these is iniquiotious and with wrath towards a Christian who has commited no great crime they are already murderers of the innocent in their hearts. Now Judas will have it easier on the day of judgement than one of these who murders a Christian, because he threw the money back and hung himself. But you are holy ones and children of light and the devil is hating you.

Now a murderer is not a soldier because it is not combat, for a brave man does not regard him, and his threatening is degenerating.

perverted morality is with the strange people beneath the Ocean, for their honesty is perverse and without truth and they do not know what is acceptable. For they speak of things as if honest but without truth and perverse that these are like those who send forth disgust and unease and the pervisity smothers the air in an unseemly scent, for they mutter obscene things as if honest and want what is wanted by some strange animal, for they do not perceive that their words are heard even in their wrath, and they leave confessions of guilt around them, for they are partially deaf to themselves and partially blind to themselves that when they believe they have deceived it is with confidence. Now if they do not believe they deceive they believe they are with those who agree.

The devil’s are speaking to those they think are their own, for the assumptions about others has lent them security.

When an ugly person would defend the ugly they are together, when ugly person would judge they are together with the ugly and both are jelous.

Now if ugly people should try to trick you saying be you ugly like us, than truly they are ugly and jelous. But the way of life is above to the wise to depart from the snares of hell.

Now the official says I pick sides based on loyalty bias that I call Mala-ver being the truth of people not being strict to a specific duty, which being loyal to a duty and strict in it I call Mala-zeve (pronounced: zeva) which is the wearing of the hat for such loyalty. Now if none is putting on mala-zeve robes than there is anarchy of tribes that are too numerous to count. Now one says, being harassed and confused, it is the tribe of the North, and another, dealing with the same, it is the tribe of the west, but there are too many tribes to be counted at a time because nothing is being official because none is putting on the robes of mala-zeve. Now if my nation is such is it a nation pleasing God? But the performance of wisdom is the label of a people group.

What it must be told is that which is a given for humans to understand that all those things are concealed for them that they do not even know shame for they do not perceive their nakedness. For with yet others they are righteous by a false righteousness of the devil and those strong in it have been purified of the truth which would cause them to stray, for they are strong in its completion. For yet others they say, I perceive Mala and care for it and so I would meddle that God does not know about me and what I do, even in the presence of God. For not even the wise of the humanist cult that has offered people lack of wisdom if it will benifit while pursuing wisdom themselves, will not see this as outrageously pointless and foolish, how they set out on pointless wars that only harass and annoy and do not deceive God, for to be so pointless is insanity even amongst Babylonians.

The angel came to places where people could not converse, for a person who would have made himself a lord said I will be a great king with what I have so that he rounded up stray dogs, especially those viscous and he rounded up base animals that had fangs of rillet and all those low and filthy things he rounded up and what was not noble, brave, or intelligent, he said I want these for the noble will not obey my commands, and he made an army of low animals and taught the animals ignoarant ways even for animals so that they would attack and harass the noble sons and daughters of people who walked with armour and clothing of noble people, and the prophet when he was there, the beautiful and charming, wise councillor, was utterly disgusted and he thought of Egypt for safety saying, They have considered this low and base thing more disgusting than any, for a low and dispicable one does this thing that no people can tolerate regardless of wars and greivancies, for it is perverse and low, and it is like a thing from the lowest of Sodom. For men cannot tolerate it, nor women and it is not safe for children. 

Let not dogs come between men, not the Egyptian and the Elsnon, nor any people displaying any shade. But a dog struck away by the visitor and the noble man has judged him innocent that it does not disrupt matters of peace. For if there are dogs that are violent than do they do good for any people? But when a violent dog has bitten the visitor it is eventually biting and attacking those who are citizens of the city. Now will any march behind a dog for it to be their captain? But the Elsnon have no use to have dogs that bite and bark at any for they are not defended by dogs. How then do we have defence? But we are defended by better things and dogs are not required for this. 

Now dogs speak a language, having abandoned the language of people, for they use our words and concepts in the way they are put forth to be concepts for dogs that dogs might have defence and attack. Now the dog has spoken many words when one tries to hit it with truth, and dogs are capable of defending themselves because a wild dog is viscous and can bite a man, and children should not be exposed to them. Now if the defence of dogs has come from them that provided the defence and they are not dogs than some have provided for dogs that they might have defence and even attack.

Now the younger generation was pleasing to the eldest and the middle was unruly, mean, and selfish, and the middle displayed unruly behaviour towards youngest who was polite so that they were cursed with the things the middle portrayed them as, and the middle said, you younger are not respectful at us who are the middle, and we are to be your keepers now that you be respecting us. For we will not tolerate your existence anymore because the middle generation gave birth to younger siblings. Now the eldest we’re growing weary and what could be done, for the youngest who knew it became fearful saying, they will destroy us if we attain anything that offends them, and they are not good to us and do it as if God will never know. For there has never been such a generation and they give birth to a generation that is not theirs by some way. For these are a luke-warm and mean generation who is unruly and easily abandoning politeness and drawn to wrath. They are like those giving up all the discipline of their parents and they speak at times as if wicked criminals. Now they have accused and said, the youngest is more these things than I, and yet God has known the truth.

Now an igno-slack has said by the lies of Pharisees, be obeying Moses. But the one who obeys truth obeys Moses, and had they obeyed God they would not have profaned his teachings in this way.

Now Lucifer even sent out power to destroy soldiers and evil beasts of the devil with one foot on the Earth and it was sent out like a wave of truth and light to destroy many of those things of the devil’s so that the holy ones might rejoice and yet the victory was not accomplished for the dust of the devil’s gathered that the devil might after a time reshape the dust into new creatures and would some of them be worse than what had been. But it could not happen quickly and yet the war seemed as if it would continue and yet it is still good Lucifer thought. Now this was not comparible to what God’s son had done in defeating, giving power, and amassing an army and the many other things God’s son had done. For He even provided the conduit to Heaven and life on Earth. Now Lucifer said, I will not cast away all that I cannot which is not in my power and my understanding does not go far enough to know if it would be right, and yet if those who would please Him would have one tongue in common to provide them with good than I will know which tongue it should be that the tower will come forth. 

Now if any is as nasty as a male buck is he a deer? But if any has hateful eyes, a vulture? But if any the teeth of a murderous hyena a dog, with eyes of jelousy? But any a hard pride, a crocodile or alligator to pounce and kill? But these traits are seen in animals than what do they mean when they come forward in people? For there is no end of learning, of gaining wisdom, and I would will that others not go to me and say I must be less than you for you have to me when I was young? But am I a fool and a base person that this would be asked of me? One does not travel to the planet and be on another at the same time. But if any would attempt to use my name for the devil than they speak it on purpose and as ignorant men when they mock and pass by. For such is like the words of a grumbler who hates, and yet some grumble in a holy fashion, being with a hidden and pure spirit within them. Now be not oblivious, I would say, but be a people concerned for the feelings of others in a way that is with justice, truth, and integrity, that you loosen for righteousness that you not attempt to force on others while judging much and most by righteousness. For if some would say, the mountain was too high for us and so let us bury ourselves in ignorance, most have sought to have the greater benifit in prudence. But at times the traits have shown to the spiritual what a person is that if these are the same as their traits than a man has the truth in his hand, but there are those being like animals who are not of that type, and such is the case with noble animals that are for those worthy of them, and many of these are great. Now the one who takes cities is not taking that city that is hard iniquity less it cause the Earth to tremble and break, but one takes a city that is rich and with acceptable things. Now if another has chosen the control than it is called better but it is not known among them who would criticize to say what is truly better. For one is choosing not the later and it is good for them. Now if one is choosing yet another thing being the law than it is not for this. But the law is for obedience and who is able to follow all of it?

But the law is for obedience and who is able to follow all of it?

Now if Benjamin is possessing goats and dwells with good tidings or is possessing lambs than or possessing those things that are good, and he is beloved, than who of another people is not despised among their people who speak wickedness against him? But degenerate fools you are listening to and you believe you are doing good? But if you would be fair than know the truth, because your people are Christians and others cannot be part of your people. For if any angel is for driving the wealthy of Babylon away than are they not knowing what you might let pass through your doors? But you are innocent as doves and not fools, therefore you know what is right, and that you have been innocent when the pastor, your leader, has not granted that some should stay according to wisdom, for such is a pastor that he is leader of a flock and a good Shepard to them when he is with integrity that should he speak well within his integrity than even great things as giant waves have haulted what they would do. But do not think I have judged any of these who are not Pharisees and are real pastors, for will I not listen to their rebuke? But what comes from kings is not the same as what comes from dogs.

Now when persecutors are gone from your land is it not abundant? But if you are defending people from persecution and the heart is right than there is no evil partner for they have been severed too many times to count.

There is one who has done wickedness as if a great plan and as if he would live forever, but he is gone quickly and this may have guessed because if there is not removal there is death, but those who are like Jacob have a legacy. For the legacy of some is dead quickly but what is in Heaven is for the after-life.

Now the gentiles of a type are saying everything with many lies so that the truth must be told without the lies, and this need not bother the conscience of any. But if any would be troubled in conscience it is a burden for them that need not be. Now if some use rillet and there are weapons fling from catapults and there are fires set and the time is of war than I assume there are many persecutors in the land. Now if it is all the last of days than it can be taken as a sign that after it has passed there will be a time before another such time that such times might be symbols that the Christ will return and if He is returning presently while it is happening than do not these receive the best warning? But I write of the signs as a matter of opinion in this thing, that tribulation has come to Earth and the planets are to be placed with people for some are not like others and are in their hearts wanting something more than life itself that these are capable as some are capable of doing one task and another capable of another and all are needed and required except that the people of the devil’s are not required but are enemies of us. Now a person must be a Christian to be so, and it is not some pointless thing as some might allude to when wanting acceptance that these are for another church. But it much is benificial to us than why am I to offer anything in this matter about what another church would do? But I do not knock as the one who commands me, and yet I do not be grateful when another is deemed worthy, but for what is good than I have been among them, with some, that if any should give they must be worthy that they are able to receive. Now I am not the Christ and if there is good done to you and you have said, but I have no respect for God, than neither did many believe in Him but some called Him great teacher. Now am I the son of God who will not judge a thing, but He is alive and well, that you may not say I am a Jew who casts out the son of God, to use a metephore, but a Christian who casts out one who must be evil and offering you nothing. But if you are then a good people than I will know.

Now if a generation spreads anarchy on the Earth than it was already close in some places because for them all to be going their ways for loyalty to bias is for there to be anarchy. Now if any is loyal to God than they are being obedient to what is from the leader when it is not against God, for Daniel bowed towards God in his room, and others, being wise, would not bow to the statue to worship it. Now the mid-wives of Egypt would not kill the Jewish children who were not their people. Now if you have not been persecuted than do you not know that some are? But wicked people are doing their own will when the eyes of their leader are not there. How will any judge by the chaos of Babylon whether any is good or bad when you have known the truth in other matters in which you have been unfairly judged. But if you are believing that the persecution is past than you are among many who are strong for your sake, but if persecution should come, know that the sign might be seen from this thing that the Christ has promised His return.

Now those giving Babylon have wronged the miserable who has come to having nothing, and deceived them in any place, and therefore a recompense of justice is just, only Christianity is to be found with it that iniquity be purged with the actions of truth. Now if such a spiritual war is fought than the war is good and it is called a primary justice, being that such is acceptable. Now if any of Babylon would lead any astray it is for exaulting itself with arragance when such is done, because envy has demanded a deed. Now if any are wishing war than let a weapon of truth and light cause them to turn to dust a little that they might know that the scorching of eternal hell is worse for them. But if there kind is using rillet than they will know that hell is not without pain and that God cannot tricked, for they only fear God a little. Now amongst their own if they are kings in arragance by which they become kings than you know that wisdom has hated such arragance but men cannot judge it, but only insolence. Now if any of them should wish for serious things against the saints than if they do so as sport they will be judged by that which fears God that their arragance and strength might turn mocking to truth within them when they are thought for, where they showed that they would rather choose lies. For God’s judgement can destroy lies and casts out insolence and gives strength and good that those seeming healthy are then understood to be unwell. Now if these are turned to kings by arragance than what are they that are sons of the kingdom? But the sons of Babylon have kings and if their king of kings is the devil than by what reason do they not consider with prudence what they do? But reality is good for war in prudence and such is offered by the kingdom of heaven because Mala and Ria are one in this. But if they mock because they do not believe than what can be said to change their hearts? But they will be what they are and if they have desired war than the fear of God is able to give them back prosperity. But those who would wage war against God are for the lake of fire and likewise for those who in a Luke-warm way disregard serious things as if they were not serious. Now if any is desiring peace can it come when one has attacked those of the kingdom of Heaven? But God is not uncaring for His children. Now if you say that Babylon will save you than you know already and must that it does not have the power, for if such rebellion is against the beautiful than how much more outrageous when it is against God. Now the beautiful are honouring God that the existence of Absolom is known to be a lie because he did what is not beautiful and such is the true story to the Elsnon which the Elsnon know to be a thing of shame because such is impossible. Now let the guilt be with the Jews for this thing but if any is becoming ugly than let it not be for the Jews but let them not deny it is their guilt, for the guilt that was for the Jews will bring them to the devil that they might be delivered to being ugly by what was done by another even if it was worse than what they have done. Now I write about spiritual things in this place and what the apostal has said and meant I do not know, for I am not with the power to know what he meant. But if any would use such to sow discord with the Jews than they do not do my will and I would want it to be acceptable.

Now if the wicked are disturbing the resting place of righteousness, than how do they, the zeolots who are calling themselves ugly, calling anything they do right by any standard? But the space between one extreme or the other is large and hard to traverse, and a person who does great discord reaps them for what is not to their benifit. Now if they mislead some with deceptions than they do not give guidance.

An abuser who is developing religion for abuse is being an animal and others do not have to be an animal because they are. They seek to be animals more when they say, fool who is human, but I am an animal and if you did not know how to handle me and manage me it is your fault, because you are the human. For they have accepted themselves as animals and have relegated their status that others might be at fault in their opinion for even allowing them to live. Now if it is of animals to blame people in this way than they are faithful to right and wrong as animals. But you are to be human and not animals, for humans have a measure of self control that they control to a degree and are good to be not controlled to a degree that they are not seeking to maul what they perceive as weakness and they understand people. Now the animal has said in their heart, you cannot expect me to keep you and govern because you are human and I am an animal and how am I to govern, for I take morality from you, because I am an animal. Now if nature is declaring it to you than you know that wisdom is benificial and that you are not a simple people who cannot know who to lead out to safety by the wrist.

Now if those who love wrestle a little it is an entirely different thing than those who mock. Now the one who is focused much on his own life is not the enemy of any and he has even cast off his family and he succeeds, for he is not concerned with the happenings of others because he has his own life. Now is he not to be a leader in the city, even in the capital, for do not think he is not pleasing to God. But he is one who succeeds and cuts himself off, saying my portion is where it is and I do not take interest in the portion of another. Joy you have given to me, and yet you do not work for me. For a wise person as this is doing wisdom and they are judging with fairness by their integrity and yet there are still things greater than them. Now let not the giving of wisdom be used for wickedness in accusations that make one dispicable and display one like a child when they are not. But if many are focusing on their own lives than many good things are concealed with wisdom that the wise do not permit the giving of wisdom to cause them to abandon life and to go into foolishness and wickedness, for they are capable.

They are slumbering so hard and with such commitment that they have turned on other people to annoy them and harass them with ignorance. Now what child is able to slumber for their days are filled with busyness, but adults are able to slumber this hard and even the teenager cannot do it. But if a woman is without a husband than she is mantaining her beauty that she not revolt and make matters worse, for her plea is not of some wish to destroy. Now the Earth is a sphere and the galaxy a disc to maintain all the capacity of a person that if one exceeds they are not exceeding but turning inwards to something different that they are not aware of. Now if you have known of other realms in the psychie than are you not worthy as a people to monitor and explore other planets? Now with Earth as the centre you remain, and it is the centre of all people who are human where ever they may go, that Earth is the centre and the planets the Islands, so that all are on Earth even if they should be on other planets. Now what are you considering the sun and planet furthest and the planet to be explored. Now what portion of the brain do you use? But if you are capable of taking than so you take, and is it not good? But you do not adhere to rebels who have attempted to cast themselves out to rebel against God. 

Now if any are consistently giving the one at peace an insolent facade is it a foolish grievance that their peace would be disturbed beyond the time of patience? But if any is without patience they remove common sense from truth. Now for what reason does any people revolt and rebel, and they do not conform to the guilt being of a different people? Now are these as compatible with you as others? But if is acceptable than you know the value of patience, that it is part of common sense. Now if you are among people groups you are not completely compatible with than you are only going through what others have gone through. But if any says be gone from us, does not what is God’s take the priority? Be not deceived for Christians are not Gentiles.

Now if any transitions to something else than you know what a person is capable of transitioning to, but perhaps not all that they are able to become when they make a real transition and not like those given to change. Now if any is saying, it is not possible to communicate with them because they are making the transition, because one must stoop down and provide compensations because even the first words are not congruent with human comprehension, than you know it is because they indeed speak another language because of the transition. Now if any has become more than they are those who are for more, but for those who squander and transform knowledge so that it might be acceptable to them, these are of a different people, and you have been called to be of the kingdom of heaven. Now why do waste time in argument with any who are not your people and why would they offer their opinion to you as if you would regard it? But those of different religions of course do not agree on religion unless they are not honouring any, and when this is understood there can be real limits by which to have peace among friends. But if those not of your people, but people of the devil are insisting to be as if one of your people as if their opinion of you would matter, than are they not acting as enemies in hatred of the enemy? But many of the devil’s are performing such in hatred of the enemy, and if the ugly have hated beauty that they might make it ugly, than you know they are for devouring and slaughtering the house of God.

Now there is the case where one would defend something as if they were better but they are not better but are the same, and this because of the circumstance of the actions that occurred whether by words or deeds and yet the first is often the later.  Now has any said I do not regard right and wrong? But right and wrong has not vanished though their hearts be stubborn or ignorant. Now if the hearts of a people by Mala are ignorant than right and wrong, the truth, does not change and they are what they are, for it would have been better for some of them if they had stayed amongst their own. But those who adhere to races by Mala are knowing the truth, that what is general to other races of Mala is unjust and disrespectful and just cause for complaint. But both that identification from the many languages and the knowledge of the races of Mala are able to co-exist without problem when Mala is there, being the truth, for if both are Mala than there is merely not enough knowledge with some, for Mala gives birth to Ria and Mala has the priority. Now the disciples were doing miracles by Mala, by that which is faith, and here Mala was instantly giving change to Ria as it is in the Universe.

Now when there is the limit, the bending back and transitioning into something else and then something else they are not aware of this is the rotation around the Earth that is called iril and when another is said to do it it is placed at the beginning or end of a concept by writing vi-iril and when it is oneself vesh-iril to signify the truth of what is truth by Mala and Ria. Therefore it is better described as the inescapable truth, and there is no journey around the Earth for a person since it can be used wrongly as a metephore which might not be accurate and it can be used in rude and disrespectful way, therefore it seems to have little place in conversation and those from a different race or people must be what they are, especially when they are the devil’s people. Now if any would be an impotent bully than it is vi-iril that such are very impotent and yet loosening their grip and not tightening for some purpose is not benificial to them. Now what is other things of such? But they are another matter and even the Elsnon women have those things. Now if one is not at the same iril as another that it is making sense that one might not be at the same level for what they are in other areas where there are levels, so that them who were the most contentious were being so because of this. Now God is solving and some things must come to completion for another before there can be clarity.

Now if any woman is cursed because her heart was to be with another than for what reason would she abandon him? But if she is not cursed was her heart ever with him so much? Now do not say it is something else when it is not as an excuse for things because people are able to know the difference. But if a woman deceives him is he wrong? But if he is wrong than a plea is to understand because the sorrow of not taking more is a hurt and wound and less so to the man, and he who puts a true wife away, she being his wife, does an iniquitious cruelty and if he is hard enough to do so what manner of cruelty is he capable of? Now if the one who says I love you most is not so, than those faithful will take her place, and a father who over defends says my daughter is forbidden until I find the right one for her. 

Now they have raised up children to be foolish to be slaughtered that they raised up those not meant to live, for a foolish man has built his house on sand and the person was filled with abundant education and given honours and they were given positions of work that were hard to attain and they provided them with medals and parades and houses for different seasons and great houses and yet it was all upon the sand because there was no good discipline and wisdom given to them that when they were given their first task requiring wisdom they were slayn with justice because wisdom was not as if natural for them to be without thought and the houses fell and what was on the sand was not. Now to what will you compare wisdom? But it delivers even from death and defends all the riches that dwell within the cities. For fools have said, we will kill every enemy, and great empires were bankrupted and when the people wandered homeless and starving the enemy attacked and slaughter them all. Wisdom stands back and laughs, as if with good and pure delight and yet it has substance that her voice is pure, filled with good charm, and she mocks at the fool who would touch her child when they are laying slayn for she is like good charm, like a charming and kind one, and she lifts up the city, it is rising to heaven, and she goes between the streets and walls where her children are doing wisely.

Now if another wife is to be had do you leave your wife away from it all that evil might be for her? But we often speak of evil in such matters and being good you will know it is an evil. For do you put her away to be a widow to take another and is this the truth of what is done? But you have left her out entirely as if she is not your wife? For why does any evil happen to her if you are not making her like a widow, for she is your wife, and the woman who would be with you also has spoken in ways as if you should make her like a widow, as if to divorce her even? But is this woman also capable of being with you? But I have done such in Mala and it is not the business of any others, for let none seperate what God has joined. Now do you take wisdom from Babylon in this that you do evil? But Babylon is not promoting the things of God.

So Lucifer perceived the rebellious animal confederation that had its ambassador appearing and manifest as a person who was angry and concerned only with the domestication of animals and they were meddling in matters concerning people who would be at peace. Now Lucifer was not for domesticating them if they did not want that and was not willing that they believe they would receive any war from him, because he was concerned with other matters and he respected their freedom. Now many symbols had emerged into the purity of people so that he said, though the animals are free we should not use their symbols because they cause error in the purity of light by which we would wield ability to fight the enemy and do good. For let the microcosm which is the whole, be pure from that of animals and cults that when in the truth are causing disruption for the light and it’s ability because the things of others is not holy and not fully compatible. Now if the people are all one and having one language than what might not be possible for them in what they would do? But there is no wall and I have no power other than war and the Babylonians, the cults, even the mixed loyalties of the noble soldiers who carry out the tasks concerning justice, are exceeding greatly in number. Now with no wall how can it be? But the wall is almost as nothing and what can it be that holds back one wall of the waves from the other? But if there is an invisible barrier than I did not place it there. 

Now Lucifer perceived that they had allowed lack of purity for strength and defence and the blocks and stones and confused guards, and all the things of defence that belonged to the devil were seized back under his control that they might turn against the holy ones, the children of light. Now he reasoned that they might have been better off to only take soldiers to war and those truly trained and truly loyal that they might have been more effective and built up a domain of peace so that better allies might be had. For they had allowed spies of dangerous zeolots in to their midst and allowed evils of their teachings to take hold, and they had carried out mistranslations to sow discord in the kingdom and attack God that His people might be partially deceived and scattered. Now truth was to be sent out and they might seek to hault it, he thought, and can I make it successful? But I fear God, and I too must place trust in Him. Now I am then councilling purity as the effective general would only take holy ones for the mission. For will a Babylonian aid in this thing? But the Christ has stolen what they gather to my delight. Now if a Babylonian will gather too and it is to be given to the Christ than I have thought one not a Babylonian will do better and gather more, for I was around the lack of abundance of the Babylonians in my youth, and have understood their attitude towards the foolishness of Christ. Now if Babylon has a king than is he favourable, or if it has a queen is she to be trampled if she would fight with us? But Babylon is changing hands and the two factions are changing and these two are filled up with the good and bad and yet they are not, either, being a direct cult for anything, for they are large marks drawn on a map, and myriad things are found in both. Now if Babylon has toppled churches, and it has, than I would perceive that it would do more, and that the church must then be more innocent than imagined by some, for I have considered that the saints are like an able group to thunder over evil in defence of what is good. Now they are slaying those who do not commit crimes and by the use of war-fare in the hands of zeolots who are a group of serial killers, and are an army of Cain and they are belonging to the devil. Now these would place discord between the church and some of its people and attempt to drive many away. For they cause many to sin for Babylon and it is the work of anti-Christs as zeolots who want it having chosen puritanicalism rather than the rewards of God that the works of God might be thrown back with some and the sun rising to be blotted out by grey clouds and barren cold where wind comes with a bitter freezing and agony takes over the land, as is much like the consequences of Babylon in many things and those who would abuse themselves with what causes an injured spirit. Now if the Christ, my commander, is healing and it is possible than still efforts to gain victories are hindered by corrupted hearts that are treacherous towards God and the saints, because the saints are sometimes more obedient to God than the Shepard who lead them, knowing the true shepard’s voice, for it is hard to steal the sheep away from the true Shepard. Now some have been hardened by conflict and it heals and becomes well, having been the work at times of those who would be against God in some thing, being zeolots who have support, that some are freshly come to make trouble with the old who make trouble, that Christians and Jews who have been hardened are having God and not much support from their nation so that one becomes great and the devil is descending. For they have even attempted to say we do not do anything to Christians and only Jews and they have said to Jews nothing, or spoken other lies to them, and they have portrayed they will leave off one and then attack the other later, and those naive to such prudence are believing in what was prepared in them, for the enemies have attacked from within the walls of nations while others amassed outside the walls for war. Now if a nation is over-run in this way than Babylon only grows stronger and persecutions more frequent when they are not able to keep their targets apart. For the papers do not report the persecution of Christians that others might be abolished at a later time, being easier to attack. But if some are hating God they will not know because the simple are not to survive nor those incapable of integrity and loyalty, though those who have it are targeted first. Now if they will take over much of the planet during a plague than does the ship only sink slowly having passed the last line of return? But this I cannot perceive and if it were so I would need more knowledge and who can say if the tide of a war will change suddenly, only disloyal hearts are scattering the people who would keep together and fight. Now let a mark be painted over the door of the church entire if it is so, because death is turning in on itself and if the Jews and Christians will survive when they have self-destructed than a time of peace might be possible.

Now when they would conquer there are stages and layers to their strategy that people are kept calm as they attack those things in the next stage and support those things that will be attacked later. For the people cannot withstand it because of the disloyalty and lack of integrity that they are constantly for allowing the attack of others if it is not them when they are to be attacked later. For humanity is sometimes taught a cruel lesson, that the trechory and murder of their hearts has been considered for what would be used to slay all of them, that they are going from one place to another and at last they too will be devoured when they have partnered with every evil in some fashion. For they came saying we defend you and they came in disguise to others saying the same and yet they are one. Now when some are in the church they dampen the efforts to fight to almost nothing when they would be leaders to silence the saints that they are capable of doing what is good for God. Now the wave may be turned that it crash upon that which sent it, that what is fired is firing backwards and destroying all that is against the Jews and Christians. For if a king has been cast out, than we can make him king forever, and this is the power they have sought to wield. Now if an enemy returns again as it had done, than it attacks from within before it attacks outside the border and what if the disloyal are willing to join them? Now if they are not executing traitors at this time than it is because for them there are other things in sight because they use many flags to carry out their missions. Now if pressure is placed to gain loyalty for some purpose than are some of the people not worth saving when little pressure is required? Now there are three nations with many people who fought against them and others as well, and if revenge is upon them I cannot say, but if they exploit a plague than do they not exploit anything? Now if this beast rises while another beast rises than which prevails? But the lamb is separated by a line of blood and if there is a ravine than let it pass over much, for if they fight, beast to beast than we are not involved, or the lamb is abolishing both, because the lamb is able to be protected by a lion. Now when they they push something too far they lose everybody, and such is true of conversation, that when a line is past all is lost unless the cities are saying only others will be destroyed. Now if your nation has fought than the armies can rise again to take vengence that the strong hand of the whole being the mighty hand is better with the righteous than with those who would seek to cut it off when it has been used, and if the owner of the hand has known it than I wish for this children to demand His hand be for them and not removed from all, for I am not able to do what His children do and indeed they are His children. Now if two beasts rise and one rises again are they using hatred of the Jews to gain your occupation and defeat? But they are promoting being free of all righteousness that they might return to what was in the days of Noah, perhaps, or when they lived without integrity of reason to give reason, the hand, over to the scattering of ignorance and nothing. But they die while another generation comes, and do they want either beast to rise, being the beast of ignorance and the giving of oneself to ignorance like bowing to what has no structure or moral guidance and takes unclean sacrificies, being nothing and the other beast that is with structure and promotes a foolish cleansing of all that is within its heart to cleanse that it does what is with another spirit that cleansed and then dies that the next generation comes and this spirit is still in the world that it might rise with the other beast at some times and Babylon is already here to be built in many ways and come more fully and yet it is with you already. Now if what they call psychology is to be their common tongue than the common tongue of others is the truth that is pure, and if the wise of the humanists are truly wise than how is there any accusation towards them? But at this time there is not because their wisdom has given them an open hand as if open of mind, to stand back like wise ones and encourage that they are being great in understanding and though they suffer fools to join them having no great gate-keeper or gate that can keep them out, yet their spirit is good and for the promotion of others and not the low and foolish tearing down of others when a person is ignorant in what they have been taught like a dog that is adorned with the master’s cloak. But their spirit is for the kindness of promotion of others, and the compassion of knowing the true, high standard of shunning abuse, that they are being great in wisdom in their spirit in this way, so that they are many of them, being great wise men and women who are like creatures of power on Earth to promote the good and the good treatment of others. For they they admire and open their hand even to what is not of them, like watchers upon the Earth that their spirits are like good shepards and wise ones. For greatness opens its hand but smallness clenches a fist and seeks to tear down. Now if the angel has listened to Frued and he has, is it not because he knew of things that are true? Now if they have a common tongue and another has a common tongue is it possible for one to be the Earth and the other the sky and clouds? But I have promoted the purity of truth and they have their own pure language that when used correctly I do not resent. Now these are at Babel and it is not Babel by confusion, that if they are builders of Babel is it not good and pleasing? But why does Lucifer then seek to build where others build? But does it not truly occur that it is only being revealed and not built by him? For he sought to build and found, that they had already made much and that it is large enough that not all of it is taken by them, because it is a great tower. Now if it is representing greatness than is it not for all? But if the truth Lucifer sends out does not injure or touch Babel than is it not constructed with wisdom? But the Christ might even be there and He is commanding me. Now Lucifer cannot take Babel and cannot take it by interloping because it has become everlasting that if it strays than it can be re-made and purified. But the place given to him is with the holy ones, the people of light, for those who have learned have resided in that place as visitors. Now the Elsnon have passage into that place and their land is able to be maintained by them with leaders to offer guidance. Now if any protection is offered by Babel to the Elsnon when it is needed than Babel has protected many. Now if fools have been roving in the land to do mischieve and violence and they attack any saying that they attack for Babel and yet Babel has not hired them or enlisted them and has not asked them for their service that they are wandering mischeiovious fools who seek to meddle as those who have no home or place with any, that these are them who like better being a soldier rather than one who wanders and is not attacking. For they are meddling fools sowing discord between nations that are at peace with other, and sin is in their steps and they speak with sin and mischeouv, for even if a rogue tribe of the wilderness should attack with also a flag of Babel they do not know its symbol and have constructed the flag on their own while they camped in the wilderness among their own, saying let us make a flag that we have some allegiance and they have not consulted any on the matter of an alliance. Now statues have been put up for the daughters and these are from Babylon where it provides statues and figures as representatives being as a spiritual cult that is not unclean and the daughters of the Elsnon have admired the statue they like and it is not wrong that they admire it, for there are statues for the ugly and there are more of them than there are ones that can be admired by Elsnon. Now some who have been for supporting Christians have called the statues being something like false-gods and yet it is not so, and they do not make sacrifices or pray to these even if in admiration some have placed things at their feet, and is the angel to be such a statue who is not to be prayed to? Now artists of various types are represented by each of the statues and some are producing their own art and others are not as it is claimed openly. Now Lucifer has not had any grievance with the young or old admiring such statues, for it is the better part of Babylon which does this, that none of these statues represents a cult. Now if Joseph is able to make his way in Babylon and be prosperous than Babyolon than is it ready to fall? But if five righteous are found in the cities of Babylon that have been closed away from others than I will believe it can stand, because the power of a lesser group of the righteous is able to spread a good infection and changing power of light that turns much evil over to good so that I would use such for war against the devil, when merely placing these into a place to live and do well that the city will be changed and healed.

Now lions are God’s that they are noble and those who encroach upon their domains are not forgiven for they are with strength and war, being mighty, and people they have killed in war that they have gone out to do battle and war on people that their zealousness is with strength and bravery for they kill all that they are for killing because such might is not to be overthrown on the Earth without a fight and war, for such is their might. Now if cities of men are encroaching will they not be mighty and strong even if it is to their doom? For man is greater than animals but such is the might of lions that they do not cowardly and stupidly surrender as if cowards who are base and are lacking the understanding, for they go out in strength, indeed they lay hard upon those who encroach that none can take from these without consequences. For do not bring children near to their places when there is a vague war firmly declared from the encroachments of man, for do you rely upon them to always do the mercy of God? But if there is war than are they safe who till and plow without weapons, who walk to buy clothing while battle and war is hot in the realms of lions? But do not be a coward with these because fear of God is what is for man, and lions may not pardon the lacking of such fear. Now such is also true of tigers and they are not for pardoning those who do evil.

Now when they would conquer there are stages and layers to their strategy that people are kept calm as they attack those things in the next stage and support those things that will be attacked later. For the people cannot withstand it because of the disloyalty and lack of integrity that they are constantly for allowing the attack of others if it is not them when they are to be attacked later. For humanity is sometimes taught a cruel lesson, that the trechory and murder of their hearts has been considered for what would be used to slay all of them, that they are going from one place to another and at last they too will be devoured when they have partnered with every evil in some fashion. For they came saying we defend you and they came in disguise to others saying the same and yet they are one. Now when some are in the church they dampen the efforts to fight to almost nothing when they would be leaders to silence the saints that they are capable of doing what is good for God. Now the wave may be turned that it crash upon that which sent it, that what is fired is firing backwards and destroying all that is against the Jews and Christians. For if a king has been cast out, than we can make him king forever, and this is the power they have sought to wield. Now if an enemy returns again as it had done, than it attacks from within before it attacks outside the border and what if the disloyal are willing to join them? Now if they are not executing traitors at this time than it is because for them there are other things in sight because they use many flags to carry out their missions. Now if pressure is placed to gain loyalty for some purpose than are some of the people not worth saving when little pressure is required? Now there are three nations with many people who fought against them and others as well, and if revenge is upon them I cannot say, but if they exploit a plague than do they not exploit anything? Now if this beast rises while another beast rises than which prevails? But the lamb is separated by a line of blood and if there is a ravine than let it pass over much, for if they fight, beast to beast than we are not involved, or the lamb is abolishing both, because the lamb is able to be protected by a lion. Now when they they push something too far they lose everybody, and such is true of conversation, that when a line is past all is lost unless the cities are saying only others will be destroyed. Now if your nation has fought than the armies can rise again to take vengence that the strong hand of the whole being the mighty hand is better with the righteous than with those who would seek to cut it off when it has been used, and if the owner of the hand has known it than I wish for this children to demand His hand be for them and not removed from all, for I am not able to do what His children do and indeed they are His children. Now if two beasts rise and one rises again are they using hatred of the Jews to gain your occupation and defeat? But they are promoting being free of all righteousness that they might return to what was in the days of Noah, perhaps, or when they lived without integrity of reason to give reason, the hand, over to the scattering of ignorance and nothing. But they die while another generation comes, and do they want either beast to rise, being the beast of ignorance and the giving of oneself to ignorance like bowing to what has no structure or moral guidance and takes unclean sacrificies, being nothing and the other beast that is with structure and promotes a foolish cleansing of all that is within its heart to cleanse that it does what is with another spirit that cleansed and then dies that the next generation comes and this spirit is still in the world that it might rise with the other beast at some times and Babylon is already here to be built in many ways and come more fully and yet it is with you already. Now if what they call psychology is to be their common tongue than the common tongue of others is the truth that is pure, and if the wise of the humanists are truly wise than how is there any accusation towards them? But at this time there is not because their wisdom has given them an open hand as if open of mind, to stand back like wise ones and encourage that they are being great in understanding and though they suffer fools to join them having no great gate-keeper or gate that can keep them out, yet their spirit is good and for the promotion of others and not the low and foolish tearing down of others when a person is ignorant in what they have been taught like a dog that is adorned with the master’s cloak. But their spirit is for the kindness of promotion of others, and the compassion of knowing the true, high standard of shunning abuse, that they are being great in wisdom in their spirit in this way, so that they are many of them, being great wise men and women who are like creatures of power on Earth to promote the good and the good treatment of others. For they they admire and open their hand even to what is not of them, like watchers upon the Earth that their spirits are like good shepards and wise ones. For greatness opens its hand but smallness clenches a fist and seeks to tear down. Now if the angel has listened to Frued and he has, is it not because he knew of things that are true? Now if they have a common tongue and another has a common tongue is it possible for one to be the Earth and the other the sky and clouds? But I have promoted the purity of truth and they have their own pure language that when used correctly I do not resent. Now these are at Babel and it is not Babel by confusion, that if they are builders of Babel is it not good and pleasing? But why does Lucifer then seek to build where others build? But does it not truly occur that it is only being revealed and not built by him? For he sought to build and found, that they had already made much and that it is large enough that not all of it is taken by them individually, because it is a great tower. Now if it is representing greatness than is it not for all? But if the truth Lucifer sends out does not injure or touch Babel than is it not constructed with wisdom? But the Christ might even be there and He is commanding me. But there are faults in Babel presently. Now Lucifer cannot take Babel and cannot take it by interloping because it has become everlasting that if it strays than it can be re-made and purified. But the place given to him is with the holy ones, the people of light, for those who have wished to learn have resided in that place as visitors. Now the Elsnon have passage into that place and their land is would be able to be maintained by them with leaders to offer guidance. Now if any protection is offered by Babel to the Elsnon when it is needed than Babel has protected many. Now if fools have been roving in the land to do mischieve and violence and they attack any saying that they attack for Babel and yet Babel has not hired them or enlisted them and has not asked them for their service that they are wandering mischeiovious fools who seek to meddle as those who have no home or place with any, that these are them who like better being a soldier rather than one who wanders and is not attacking. For they are meddling fools sowing discord between nations that are at peace with others, and sin is in their steps and they speak with sin and mischeouv, for even if a rogue tribe of the wilderness should attack with also a flag of Babel they do not know its symbol and have constructed the flag on their own while they camped in the wilderness among their own, saying let us make a flag that we have some allegiance and they have not consulted any on the matter of an alliance. Now statues have been put up for the daughters and these are from Babylon where it provides statues and figures as representatives being as a spiritual cult that is not unclean and the daughters of the Elsnon have admired the statue they like and it is not wrong that they admire it, for there are statues for the ugly and there are more of them than there are ones that can be admired by Elsnon. Now some who have been for supporting Christians have called the statues being something like false-gods and yet it is not so, and they do not make sacrifices or pray to these even if in admiration some have placed things at their feet, and is the angel to be such a statue who is not to be prayed to? Now artists of various types are represented by each of the statues and some are producing their own art and others are not as it is claimed openly. Now Lucifer has not had any grievance with the young or old admiring such statues, for it is the better part of Babylon which does this, that none of these statues represents a cult. Now if Joseph is able to make his way in Babylon and be prosperous, than Babyolon, is it ready to fall? But if five righteous are found in the cities of Babylon that have been closed away from others than I will believe it can stand, because the power of a lesser group of the righteous is able to spread a good infection and changing power of light that turns much evil over to good so that I would use such for war against the devil, when merely placing these into a place to live and do well that the city will be changed and healed.

Now the devil’s have said that while they are fighting we attack from behind their lines of defence to obliterate humanity and cripple it, for we are soldiers of the devil’s and we can even work together for our common evils let us know where our allies are. Now if there is recompense after the fighting it is good, that the Earth be made clean, but if you leave it does it become devoured? For if the way of Jews kills it and the way of Christians also than surely you know what is required.

Now all have the common tongue of Babel and it is given more as they build and all have the truth and are given more or having less, and yet such matter cannot be created or destroyed for it goes to one or the other. Now if one goes to being animal than they are an animal of same amount of matter and if they come forth from another realm, their spirit completing the different lives when they are set aside for such, than how would it be that there are any who could perceive it? But if any perceives it than how many lives do they live? For if they are given chances again there is no morality or consequence for Christians and this cannot be compatible with us. Now if the after-life is having the spiritual or heavenly body than for what reason does any fool boast in doing wickedness. But if such is not even advantageous in legacy than neither is it advantageous presently. 

Now if any has transformed to being beyond an animal but a relentless desease, than they are a desease and sickness from the devil to be used as a weapon against God’s people and even to be directed at the angel, for the desease attacks that which is a threat to the devil and his purposes and it is a desease that would seek to hinder and hold back humanity as a species. Now such desease even come in the form of zeolots who have been transformed into the desease from the devil.

Now those being transformed into disease that is a weapon of the devil’s are not often having knowledge of why they have been sent out only they have been sent out by those whose hearts are directed by the devil that what must be attacked by him is to be attacked because it is not prudent to allow God’s kingdom to take ground against the enemy and if it would take a great city than how much worse and even a province than why will the devil not attack and why will he not attempt to kill Abel? But if Babel is being made and the Elsnon given wisdom than how he not be losing much ground? But if the devil’s dwell with wicked animals and are ignorant of what is known to a man than they feign anger at common truth in forced zeal for their cause, for those who break away from even their hearts are those who remain within them that they are perverting themselves that they show they are at war with God. But if any struggles yet does right, they are blessed by me as very worthy. Now if any would attempt to go back at times than it is the case that some make it worse what they would go back from that what they do not like is increased and there is one who makes things worse with much control, that if any is poisoned than if they would poison themselves also they are making things worse.
------------------------------------------------
Now if I have written about wars than am I then commanding war or calling for war? But I have chosen to make it understood that a nation is not circumsized the way in which ancient Israel was circumsized and how a great a thing it was that God had chosen a people group who would obey him and do His will, for there was much obediance and sense of respect for God in the way the prophets might be adhered to and regarded, while at present we live in the last days, and not the former, where the persecutions are less tolerant of religion so that only a luke-warm  version of religion, that does not offend with any great obediance, is that which is considered acceptable and not to be persecuted, and such is the worst state of a person, to be neither choosing a side for rebellion against God or passion for Him and obediance, that such are those who blaspheme and profane in their words of religion because they do so with luke-warmth in general in which they speak such, that they say they do not wish to obey or rebel, and they say as they speak, that they regard much the religion, that there is not repentance, so that it would be better to say, I repent, or better to say, I refuse to pray, and such is one who takes serious thing seriously, who is not profaning and blaspheming and is not acceptable to the society of the last days, unless it is the rebel at times, although often the rebel, too, is hated and resented, as that which is taking truth seriously. Now if I have not ordered or commanded any to war, and have mentioned matters of circumcision, than some are for the circumcision of a nation, and even for the restoration of Israel to be as it was, and yet anti-Semetism is dieing in some places and re-emerging in others, and many attempts are made to bring non-Jews to hatred of the Jews, so that I have even found some frustration with how some things have been worded in the letters of disciples, that could have, in my opinion, been worded so as to not sow discord, for such considerations can be made, and discord can be sown by bringing about resentment of another group even by how a group might be described in a way that denegrates another group. But if the truth is to be told, than all sometimes must be read, and understanding must be used, even to avoid the problems of a bad translation that has been translated badly intentionally so that discord can be sown.
	But I do not call for war, or command it, and I do not call for or command violence, only Christianity is the religion of this book and the first, and is the first priority, as this book and the first are only meant to give wisdom, and must be taken for what it is and how it must be understood, that it is not a seperate religion. Now gay men are not, to my knowledge, considered to be the unrighteous who cannot enter the kingdom, but are considered to be fornicators, as what is known about in the Old Testiment is the definition of what is called sin in matters of sexuality, being that fornicators are those who commit what is not polygamy where a man has multiple wives, or where he has one wife, or where people have sex outside of marriage in a way that is not adultry, but anything else, being that other things are considered to destroy the temple, being that a person is considered to be the temple. Now if puritanicalists have taught other things, than does it not sow discord between the Christ and people who would be Christians? But it is true that marriage can happen prior to marriage, and if this is truly so, than the two will know of it, only such is a matter that is private and personal for them, that it is not a thing that I attempt to bind with any words. Now I have perceived much discord being sowed between people and the Christ in the false-teachings that have become rooted in the Christian churches and bad translations that have been intentionally translated wrong, so that another religion with false teachings emerges. Now the angel does not control any church, but the church that is worthy tolerates him, that he offers what he does that is the truth, and yet he does not, again, control it, for the angel is the angel of the church. Now marriage is forever, and yet there are occassions when there is not marriage to begin with that I have already mentioned those who marry as if dwelling with a prostitute and that the Babylonians do this, and if the Romans are apethetic than they are also not sacrificing, and neither of these represents the Gentiles, but a people is so assuming because of their ways of education and the fiction that they read, that they have had teachers in churches who have posited interpretations and how these things have happened is uncertain, only the sons of Orgoth have sought to control, and because some have fought against others when justice in standing up for themselves was not occuring as if with no cause, there has been an easy way to recruit, that they have seen people act as if zeolots, and this is not common, to act without cause and speak against without cause, among those of a shade, so that they have not perceived the differences between those of the devil's and those who are not, because those in greater advantage have said, yet we will be compassionate and repent, and it was as if vengence for the sins of the fathers, which is not the scripture in the Old Testiment, so that great wickedness is perceived, and it is as if rebellion against that which is not responsible, and seeks to do good, as if giving evil for those who would give good and are giving good, that those who see are more commited, and others have joined, because those who would say, yet it must be, because our people are not capable, have not known that those they defend are of the same shade and they are the only who are not, so that mala has gone far for those who perceive the truth, that much is seperated with an exceedingly sharp knife, because the truth has required it, because the people are not understanding with ease, so that those who would do work in this way, are doing work with what is light, that the knife is exceedingly sharp and made of light, and the Lord provides good when light is truly used, that those who weild truth are doing the work of God.
	Now as for the discord that the servant of Orgoth would sow, the one I call Orgoth's servant, not much must be considered in terms of his attempts to sow discord, for sentience knows it all, and he does more evil by only being noticed, that his cause is perverse, for he is not as the two who are higher than him, that they do not insist upon doing anything for no reason, and yet they are below the Earth, even if not below Ur as of yet, for in time they will be, and yet it is below the Earth, below land, which is and among them there is the river of fire which flows down the mountain of Orgoth to the three shelves, and Orgoth's servants is sending out servants of Orgoth, and they are preached to by deception and they are those who are hated even by criminals in much of the evil they support, that they are for slaying children for no reason, and killing for no reason, and commiting violence for no reason, and denying sentience, and rebelling against a God, when they will be defeated, blaming people for no reason, and inventing reasons when there is no reason, and the servant is molesting children and killing them, and do not the Babylonians have much use of Orgoth's servant? But to a land which has idealized wisdom and that which is idealized to be a thing of wise peasants in politeness, for I do not use 'peasant' in a way intented to offend, but it is a matter of self-direction, of control, and what one calls an idealization of what is peasant, another has called something different, and yet still to them, they have competed with what to them is declared by wisdom to be Joshua & Vikings which is to be the nation for them, and yet to those in those places it is Joshua defiled by Babylon and even Rome, and if there are Vikings, they are deemed to be wicked. Now to others it is Israel but without cirumciscion, only some of what is brought by justice, and some are living in a niche land, in which the rest is not seen. Now if zeolots have been acting in such a land, than there are movements hi-jacked by the strong hand of the media, which is part of the strong-hand of Babylon, so that things might be pushed to an extreme in order to recruit more to lack of sympathy for a cause and lend sympathy and recruitment to a cause, for the purpose was not to bully and intimidate, they might say of anything to come and what was, for tactics are sometimes similiar, and connections are then made between such and others in a way that is not in keeping with the morality of such places. Now if any wishes to be a virgin who is woman or man, and hates because of it, than the choice is theirs, and they have their own selves to fight if that is the fight they choose, only such voices are used to recruit and for foolishness and great evil, that wickedness is done because of simplicity. Now if any wishes segregation it is the same, and yet such voices are used for recruitment to a cause. Now if any wishes to kill those offending a religion, they are probably supporters of extremism, and yet such voices are used for recruitment.
	Of course there are many problem with ICEL, being the terrorist gang that is servants to the Orgoth's servant, whereas Neo-Nazi would be servants of the third shelf son and a group like Al'Queda or ISIL would be servants to the second shelf son. The group's main recruitment efforts would be the proliferation of exxagerations concerning feminism, liberal foolishness, and cases of sexual abuse, where stories are invented or real and are exxagerated to a degree as to convey a sense of foolish and unreasonable persecution in order to create greater amounts of support in society for those against victims of sexual abuse, or child abuse, or any type of abuse that INCEL might wish to lessen support for. The days of a shift from insufficient concern to sincerity on a topic, has been replaced by a shift from sincerity to a sense of persecution by anti-human sociopaths who are seemingly attempting to attack and ruin as many people as they can on the planet due to some grievance they themselves must have with their own existence, by which they wish for every person to be ruined and killed. The idea can be conveyed by even a painter and it can be implanted in society by a skilled communicator who wishes to create the greater sense of reality by what is shown and not what is told, relying, of course, on sane people to interpret the truth and not follow what has been told to them. This shifts the message to the message that is shown and not what is actually said, and is a technique of propoganda, that has been mastered to a high degree by many. I can write a story in which I say green people are evil, or I can exxagerate my support for green people killing thousands or millions of innocent people and tell people that green people deserve our sympathy and compassion and that it is not their fault, to further hope for a boast in moral outrage. By this method I would probably hope for violent attacks in the street on green people, and this is a matter then of finding the right balance for those writing propoganda, to know how far to push the audience in what is shown so as not to incur a retaliating outbreak against the person writing the propoganda and those they work with. The media does this often, depending on the network, and some networks have even become tabloids for hatred, hoping for greater viewership, most likely. The sheer amount of propoganda that is presented from various media sources is most likely staggering, and yet I have not yet seen a study reported or a class offered in high-school that would teach people about the amount of propoganda in society. Why people who hate are so often drawn to places where they might produce propoganda might have much to do with who owns and operates a media network or radio station, and the idea that Orgoth would like to control the world entire should not surprise anyone whether they believe in Orgoth, or only the existence of terrorist gangs.
	The real talk still has not occured on mental health, and passive-aggressively connecting mass shootings to mental illness is not helping, and is outrageously offensive, just as having a talk about the Jews would be offensive after a mass shooting, or middle-eastern people, or Chinese people, or hispanic people. The idea of labelling somebody a monster is not offensive after a mass shooting, but labelling them mentally ill when they were not diagnosed is offensive, and given the variety of evil that can exist and be commited by people who merely hate and were not bullied by anyone but desire to kill people because of the sheer level of evil that exists within them is not always understood by those who are good, since it is hard to imagine the type of person who would join a terrorist gang to kill sexually active people because they believe that life is not fair and that other people are to blame if they are beautiful and they consider themselves ugly. The real mental health system, and not that conveyed on television, is most often a world where good psychiatrists are removed when they are not willing to cover for other collueges and where rape victims and child molestation victims are ignored and even labelled with mental health problems when they in fact have the problem of having been victimized by sexual abuse. Some sexual offendors have even come to take for granted the idea that the mental health system and society will defend them if they are being accussed of commiting sexual abuse, so that they have gained an impression that they are a good citizen, and that there is nothing wrong with their actions, and that nobody should tell on them, and to tell on a adult in this way is a viscious and hateful attempt to ruin another person for no reason, and even an attempt to kill another person for no reason. They believe that they are not only good citizens but that society is actually there to support those who commit sexual offence and that the mental health system is for dealing with the problem of a hostile victim who is attempting to ruin a sexual offendor, so that if any person is ever taken to prison for sexual abuse, it must be because they angered someone in power and not because they commited sexual abuse. That the attitude has become so strong with some sexual offendors is not sheer wishful thinking, but is a result of the steady efforts of INCEL gangs to gain support against victims and it is also due to the ease and lack of official procedure with which any person can be taken to a mental health facility by the police against their will. Imagine teenage girls, some of them, who only seem actually mentally ill after they have been bullied and arrested and then bullied and ignored and detained in a mental health hospital, possibly multiple times, because they were molested or raped and are being bullied into silence, and then imagine a society that is increasingly permitting this to happen, and a police force that is not investigating complaints and reports but seems to be partnering often with the efforts of INCEL gangs, pedophiles and rapists, and you can then gain a better understanding of North America, in all its reality and all its horrific evil, and understand how disgusting our society can truly be. Of course after going through the ordeal of being bullied and arrested for being a victim many young woman might seem mentally ill, as where such occurs there is usually an indication that they have been put through too much and have developed what might seem like a mental illness but actually is not. How we have come from an overly considerate Elizabethan society, in some ways, to be a society that is cruel to many women in this fashion seems to be the result of cruel individuals who have abandoned their own common sense for the belief in the lies of others who have labelled nice young woman with mental health problems they do not have in order to cut them off from trust when they attempt to tell others of their abuse or gain help from the police. Men should not be decieved in this way, and the idea that people would lie against victims is something that should be common knowledge for men. Many of these mental health facilities have become an INCEL gang's dream facility, and they can be equivelent to terrorist bases for some of those who are taken there by police.
	Cries for help do not always come with television show stereotypical emotion and some victims have been ignored so many times when they have tried to get help that many, especially woman, but sometimes males, tend to ask for help by stating things in a matter of fact way without emotion, a result of having told others, most likely, who simply ignored them when they attempted to get help. It is not my intention to mention the reasons for this in greater detail, only I would be happy when men are able to understand others with a high level of understanding, something that seems to be attacked by television and films that exxagerate everything in a way that ignores the ability of people to understand and sometimes creates misunderstandings. A sense of power that is fictitious might feel good for some people, but it is not empowering, not in reality, and only helps to cover up the real problems that must be addressed for victims, even to save their lives sometimes when their lives are in jeopardy. Rapists and pedophiles can be extremely dangerous, although they do not seem to realize it, as they are also so self-absorbed as to believe that they are the real victim of something, ignoring their own actions in a way that does not honestly assess themselves for how truly evil and dangerous they are. Of course no person lives forever, and those below ur have the greatest impulse for self-preservation of any human on the planet whereas those not below ur, some of them, are those who are much more open to the idea of self-sacrifice, or dieing for others in a noble way and due to love. Of course every person has an impulse for self-preservation, but there have been some who have said, who would want to live forever? It is not likely something to be found in the mouth of a rapist or child molestor.

A dog describes a human from themselves, and their mouth is full of projection, for they do not have the means to understand and describe. This is a folly found in Babel.

A dog has put on the clothing of a lion to gather up those who wish to be lions and has taught them the teachings and ways of dogs, to be dogs but insolent and brutal, as if to be strong and mighty.

A fool is a slanderer of those they hate, but a wise child will sometimes be fair to others in words.

A fool panics and believes everything can be fixed with bullying, and what a low fool it is, but a person of patience has great understanding.

A passive aggressive man pleads innocence, but a righteous son has blessings.

A wise man says, he may murder soon, and the wise heed it as well, but a foolish people are saying there is no such thing as abuse anymore.

According to sentience there is no cause to judge, and this is a fool who is perverted within, for he has placed strength against justice.

Be permitting woman what is acceptable for them, for all know what is acceptable. 

Because a woman can strike a woman, the woman asked must agree, but in such a case another is expected to understand.

Because they were unwilling to do the work of God, especially justice, they would rather afflict and abuse victims of evil, and there are places where they do this.

Both Sodomites and Gomorrites slay with guile, but those who want peace are having a good gratitude because of understanding.

But one by wickedness does not comprehend conventions of anotherâ€™s speech in judgement, for they are enraged with jelousy, but there is a servant who is close to blameless.

But out of time and place is it not animal that is threatened? But their reasons are irrelevant to what they do with mouth and deed.
But the Lord God, His works I have seen, that He takes much action on Earth, for He can cause a nation to crumble without war or enemy on Earth.

But they are suspicious of truth and attack because it is not in the low Babylonian way of speaking that is filled with deception and lies.

But what is the cause of this change for evil that has happened? But a man has then known, I do not go where the river would take me, but there is justice neglected to do in some matter, therefore I do justice.

But when Ahab was king and the soldiers of Babylon marched towards Elijah rather than speak wickedness what does he say? But if I am clean, a man of God, he speaks.

But when are Enoch bringing down a mammoth? But they are fishing and there are smaller things.

Did they not know that they said differently? But the devilâ€™s soldiers have greater self-control than the Lordâ€™s people. For the devilâ€™s soldiers are not able to do what they are made to do because of morality on Earth.

Escalation is not foolish when wickedness becomes outrageous, because the land must be saved and the good inhabitants.

For a man in truth has not desired an animal, and a woman not the one who is not her husband.

For a murderous person, what is not worth time and judgement, is worthy of murder, but those who keep justice keep the land.

For giant spiders have cast webs that the good might be swallowed, so that prudence is good, but gateways are opened and people floating down on pure creatures to give passage and way to the gates for their salvation.

For have I not given attention? But there is the generation error where some believe a thing is new that was expressed in a similiar fashion many generations prior, for it was always easily understood.

For if they are restrained by need for secrecy, they are developing their skill at hiding from truth, but the people who please God are becoming lights upon a hill.

For their inner heart knows it that they do not, for what should be occuring to them in terms of evil they are of much heart to do to others, for the inner heart cries out for justice to be done to the person who has the heart.

For there is a failing towards you that is as a blameless trechory for which there is no judgement or wrath, but it is only what occurs.

For though men above land and above ur cannot comprehend the hearts of those whose hearts are in the lake of fire, they would perceive it as something higher but know what is still evil and wrong. 

For we have not given permission to any soldier to destroy our society though they have enforced, and to defend those beneath ur in their attacks, though they are to be roaming against them.

For when it comes to calling names in a low way, how is it a person knows it is projection? But a realm exists of light, and it is the realm of the philosophers, for they are not warriors with such light and cannot do any battle on Earth.

How much more the man who women of the devil even are jelous of, but the woman is not made man by uglieness. For she has said on sight, it is not for me to inherit.

If any is being foolish and determined as if lacking common sense than they have already received the command from their group of hell and wickedness, for they have received from Orgoth and do as they believe they must.

It is nature for those who are the devilâ€™s to accuse when they are guilty of what they accuse, but it has not occurred to many a child who is Godâ€™s.

Let a woman find her husband, for the world is filled up with distractions and ways to stumble, that where she gives herself there her husband is, that if she loves his house and it is pleasing to God, she wants a good thing.

Let the devilâ€™s house wage war against itself and if you will, you may be following good in the light.

Now a father must not defend the beast that has departed from their house if it is goring and attacking, when it should be killed, for if he is blameless he is understanding justice.

Now a fool is not putting his animal slaves to work, for poverty will come upon him and all his house.

Now a fool will dismiss great amounts of wisdom and understanding with coarse words and a gesture, for they are not for it, but the cults of Babylon have their own beliefs which are lies, for the statue is the god of them who judges right.

Now a warrior of projection is scorning and rillet is in their mouth, but they are kept by others and it is not their own work.

Now Babylon has an army of slaves and itâ€™s numbers are large. Now three-hundred Greeks made them pay greatly, but for India I turn back for the sword does not devour forever.

Now Babylon has what takes all good and turns it to evil, for they would claim for profit, but they may profit less. Now they are melting in their furnaces to change to evil, and the Lord and the Christ must then know if an angel rescued any.

Now for those like engineers and scholars who are not for combat, take not without permission from the honourable who is a soldier and then be of good conscience to offer nothing of aid or repayment in return, for these are as if they are being praise-worthy, and you rob and then offer nothing. But David has not taken wives he grew up with, and he has not failed to do justice in many ways. Now he is innocent by the Lordâ€™s standard and will you find guile with his mouth? But these stealing and not repaying are making themselves like dogs, like little perverts who have no sense of honour, for they meddle in things for descretion, but Jude does not meddle but is upright, without envy, showing himself servant of the Christ, beloved as Benjamin, loved more for his consideration of what others have not considered. For he saves all the soldiers who are in intense battle, and the tide is more turned to their favour that they do not die. Now one is not the other and they are opposites, and it is then known when there truth that one is like Benjamin and the other behaving in an opposite way, for one is the kingdomâ€™s, another the Jewâ€™s, another the devilâ€™s, and I will boast of the Jewâ€™s and the Kingdomâ€™s.

Now I would like to establish villages of prophets for when such is done the core is established, for the core of Godâ€™s nation is the prophets but an uncircumcised nation is a tangle of Babylon.
Now if a Babylonian has a demon is the man not an allie of the demon? For the demon breaks into the open and the man has a companion in war.

Now if a dog snaps and harasses a bear is it not righteous what the bear does to it? But what keeper of dogs is sending a dog to harass a bear?

Now if any woman is putting on light of purity and matching jewals of Virtues than she is made beautiful, and a woman of many virtues and a daughter of Sarah is not as other women. 

Now if Babylon is crushing masses than let them not turn to Orgoth, for the two are partnered, but better to run to what is offering safety, being the kingdom of heaven.

Now if it is too simple, yet it is true? But the one is knowing the wrong of his employerâ€™s dealings and they are not, that truth is with one and not the other, and the angel has learned.

Now if it is truly a queen than they are supporting those loyal to the people to be councillors and what is of governments, for they will not be sensing threat from these if they are a queen.

Now if Orgothâ€™s highest son would wipe out those who serve Orgothâ€™s servant why would I intervene? But Orgothâ€™s servant gathers his people and they make themselves a bother and burden, for some of them are below the ocean, the line of reason, and it is most, for indeed they are speaking the id and it is that which was not to be regarded, that without reason it renders itself as a reason because they are not able to comprehend, for it is perverse honesty from deception, being the deception of the heart. Now all sick animals are with Orgothâ€™s servant and they are devoured to descend there and be amongst their own.

Now if the animals will be seperate, and are, and look out and hear and see and offer their judgements of people and what they do and say, know that justice is the devil to take them for his own for this thing.

Now if the light of the face threatens the animal that it attacks rather than be in terror than it is bowing, for it would rather bow 
as if before a god, but those with self control keep themselves from falling in attack that they bow.

Now if the person is not admitting they are a fully committed soldier of the devil, but they are saying they do not know better, or that their intentions are good, then they are a very sick dog.

Now if the soldiers are like an occupying force than they are Babylonâ€™s soldiers, and if not they are the nations in Ria.

Now is it for the Jews to describe the inner part of the temple of God? But am I given choice to disobey in this thing?

Now is there more time for the animal? But they make themselves zeolot in their disbelief in God, for they want only to be that they might descend again to animal and they cannot be human.

Now it is good for a woman to be finding her husband, and let the wise consider it, for there are many people and God is able to make luck and chance but will the devil attempt to hinder it?

Now something seems to be done where some are being taken and separated from their groups and they are brought high as if always so, and so it was, and yet I do not know what it is for I do not know of the Christ having returned.

Now the abuses on Earth, is it not disgusting and outrageous? But people are able to live in peace, and they are not regarding much things of dogs and their cruelty towards people.

Now what do animals want? But they have no keeper, they are not human, and they are threatened by something, or there is what they want to steal. Now there is little morality with the animal. Now such is when the animal is pestering.

Now when a criminal of the criminal realm is entering into good lands, the criminal is in Godâ€™s Universe still and in good lands for the priority is not to the criminal.

Now when one is learning within a community of Babel and another is with another community, is love not troubled? Yet it is good for perseverance that if one is so they will not always be stolen away by Babel.

Now when the soldiers of cities are permitted it is sometimes the case that justice is being permitted, for if there is no meddling than justice is abundant.

Now when the soldiers of cities are simple and stubborn to be simple, it is war with swords and arrows against the people entire, but where they judge rightly a king is upon the throne to stand instead of the wicked.

Now where is the saber-tooth tiger for I have not seen it and maybe it is too dangerous for it to be seen.

Now with some, are you asking too much of a human for them to judge without great bias? But some ugly cannot judge the beautiful, and they will only deny it, even to their death.

Orgoth has been the enemy of the angel so that he would lean upon the mighty that Godâ€™s will would be accomplished, but those who mock at such precautions are not friend or believer.

perverted morality is with the strange people beneath the Ocean, for their honesty is perverse and without truth and they do not know what is acceptable.

Some of the wise are not to be ribbed, which is joking, or wrestled, which is friends, and much wisdom and understanding are with these who know how the world works.

Strength by insolence is insanity, but the mighty are able to speak like people.

The animal retaliating against all limits of morality and lack of abuse is belonging to the devil, but the righteous know what is acceptable.

The animal retaliating against all limits of morality and lack of abuse is belonging to the devil, but the righteous know what is acceptable.

The animal with incomplete knowledge has hide behind animals before the sight of the sword, but a man of great worth has stood against an army to die immortal.

The children of propoganda are the unplanned pregnancy of war, and they have believed that the acts of war were for peace and education and for truth, that they are a grievous burden among the people.

The context of words makes them offensive or not offensive but the one who removes context is attacking with insanity.

The devil has placed that which is for keeping his people at a level of ignorance so they are not coming to their senses to refuse to be thrown into hell with him.

The devilâ€™s are speaking to those they think are their own, for the assumptions about others has lent them security.

The ego of a fool is flexible to inflate and match anything, and yet only the inflated ego can match, but the arragance of a mighty is not without substance.

The ego of a fool is flexible to inflate and match anything, and yet only the inflated ego can match, but the arragance of a mighty is not without substance.

The imposter who would cast out the true heir is as Jacobâ€™s older brother, for they are servant until they are casting off the servitude.

The man who has only preyed upon children and never learned to be among others is not capable to be the innocent one with those who are adults, so that it seems as if confusion occurs.

The one knows nothing and nothing about being a man for a child has placed his foot on his neck, but a man has gone because of his good.

The one who does what is right, taking right action is defending the house of God, but for those taking wrong action it is not so.

The one who has erred has voiced a bad opinion of the one who has fullfilled well, and so they are cast out with their words, that if they are cast out they can be retrieved if they are worthy, that they need not be afraid in stubborness.

The one who is not belonging is attacking them who would be an allie, for they are not grafted by attacking the allie.

The one who would kill the righteous for disrespect against the Lord commits blasphamy and profanes in their evil, but the son and daughter is in the house, and the foolish predator dwells outside.

The one with much anger and hostility is kindled to greater anger by the good of another. For when they are angry for no reason they are kindled for no reason.

The person taking greatness in destruction are those who have failed entirely, for they have perished and lack themselves, but those remaining with integrity are going through tests and tribulations, and these are for reward.

The person who is imposter and not worthy is of great and false self worth when they attain, but the true heir is as Jacob, is lifting up righteousness.

The person would rather follow the male around, than follow women around, and he is blind to all woman, for they do not exist for him, and yet he has not desired the male, but is with much jelousy.

The projection of animals is many, and their wrath is a calamity when it is against what is higher than them.

The scale of Babylon is a hazard but the Lord is righteous.

The tiger encountered the moth in tigerâ€™s clothing and the moth could not wrestle for the tiger knew it was a moth, and it was puffed up and reviled and presented a facade of insolence and with great sputtering of ignorance crumbled to pieces.

The wicked are not wishing to comprehend justice, for to look in all directions from land is not for them.

The wrath of a servant is his wife, for he keeps with silence and she rages with wickedness, but the strategic wife of a noble is slaying the low one herself.

The zeal for foolishness and ignorance is an unholy flame, but the one with understanding has peace in what is good.

The slave is not concerned if they are sinking the boat entire, but a righteous man is possessing more from God than them.

A person has wanted the killing to occur and they have gone away into imprudent concealment, for the insolent facade has emboldened them, and yet none take action, and the wicked conceals.

There is a person who believes the majority of a place is like them, that they believe the world works the opposite way of what it does, but another knows how insolent they are being, that when they participate with them, they know the truth.

There is a woman who sows discord in her meddling and yet she has not intended much harm, and those she has defended are burdened by it and groaning in the heaviness of the thing.

Those who control the soldiers control the nation to take it by force, but where soldiers are loyal to no change a frail house sits upon rock.

Those with less have sent out a bickering tongue with envy, but a kind answer shows forth greatness that jewals and gold drop from the king of great wealth.

Those with nothing rage greatly by measure of their lacking, but a wealthy king has indulged many complaints.

To remove any layer of context is an attack carried by insanity, but integrity is in the way of reason.

To remove common sense, nothing functions as it actually is.

To the third son of Orgoth: pride that devours and its children: devouring the poor, devouring the humble, devouring the compassionate, devouring mercy, devouring love, devouring kindness.

What is in the lake of fire may be dealt with by Orgothâ€™s servant, but Orgothâ€™s servant is the lowest thing for men on land.

When an ugly person would defend the ugly they are together, and when an ugly person would judge they are together with the ugly and both are jelous.

When they have no reason, being nothing by wisdom, they proceed into insanity that they might be insane and unreasonable.
When words reach the level of combat soldier it is violence towards another, for it is physical, all, that a person being violent is in the place of combat.

When you let an animal sit at the table even the calamity of animals will rebuke you and their mouths will rebuke you, and there is little peace, but with people it is not so.

Why are you telling me something? Now what more is needed? But 'are' is better and 'how' and 'if' that many things are for them with a sharp sword.

Wisdom is found on the lips of the righteous that understanding is great, that the hidden is with the righteous.

You cannot kill the heir that you might inherit.

But what are some things of Babylon? Now there are those saying, I will become rich only by my being evil, that they are small, and being simple. Now there are the gathering of those who are for being evil, that politeness and injustice, they believe will make them rich, and they depart from wisdom. Now there is the furnace that transforms things to be acceptable to Babylon, and the sign was given of three wise Jews who would not adjust to be bowing in their works to be bowing to Babylon. Now the sign was given that the angel saved them that they did not become devoured by the furnace. Now the statue of the Christ is there, for luke-warm worship and blasphemy. Now the statue of Babylon, the king, is there, that the artists and authors might bow to be acceptable to Babylon. Now have not merchants been part of this in ways? But there are the corrupted merchants, who claim values they do not have, and they have said, but works must bow to Egypt and even to Babylon before they are able to be sold. Now it is not always so, but it is an injustice for these. Now the cult of suicide has emerged that it begins to grow and yet it is only small at the time of Abishag reigning over the meeting place in Salem. Now is not the cult fashioning itself as a thing of Babylon, by which to grow? But there are even the religions of Babylon, that are nothing, and being of no weight and worth, and they are even being greater developed, and yet their names are not known much among the people, and they are as if meditation without religion or anything of value. Now how is it that Nicolatains, which are considered by the angel to be Babylonian, are seeming to have demons, for they have perversities of Babylon and also demons that are strange, and yet they have practised no meditation, as some have thought demons only come from meditation in things that are evil and Babylonian religions. Now those who gain wisdom with the Lord as their teacher, are they not said to be in meditation, and it is said to be so always, and yet they do not indulge in the ways of nothingness and poisoned but clean waters, that some have claimed bring about demons. Now Babylonian priests have been partnered with the teaching and practise of such meditation, that it is considered a well thing for those who suffer in anxiety. Now there are those demons that exalt when it is wicked to be distracting, and is it not a disturbing thing? But the angel has not seen all, and does not know if there are Babylonian Ahabs and Harods, for he writes between the passage of the comet, the sign, from Saturn and Jupiter to it passing Earth. Now what they call 'microsoft' a thing of machines and devices, does not seem to be actually Babylonian, that it is a good example, that some things are not actually so, but almost always they are Babylonian if it seems so. Now the angel does not hate this merchant of devices and machines, and yet the children of angels are seeming to favour another thing more, and are they not in keeping with children of angels, for the angel also at times uses what they use. Now does not the book of Ezekial give some insight into this? But will the children of angels one day be required for these things as well? Now the children seem to move towards preparing for a great persecution, and they only have things to avoid, and is it not good?
	Now Babylon is having many other things that are mentioned, and who will make this diary that people are able to find the knowledge they require? But let them save the original and organize it better if it pleases them, that people be able to find what knowledge they want. Now if it pleases them, let them write companions that guide and essays that give insight that it is not considered blasphemy to be writing about it, for even if they write blasphemy, yet it is a diary to be written about. 

A false priest of decency and purity for women, who is a murderer only and not even a priest, that they are as a corrupted and insane priest who is not with integrity, that they are not really a priest, this is found among the INCEL gang for protection, that they are jelous murderers and there can be no reasoning with them, for the reasons they give are lies, and their jelousy is given a device that is a way of priests, that there are those, for them, who are threatening the purity of others, and are threatening purity by romantic love, for such is not acceptable to such a priest, for they are not even Babylonian, and yet they believe in the false-religion that they have created, of puritanicalism and a false weight, that those who are desired are evil, for only by being desired they are threatening the purity of others, for they are somehow at fault, or must be, in order for it to be so, that they have sinned or must be sinning in some way. Now they are extreme for this purity, and hypocrites in heart, and they are believing in death for intimidation that they feel towards them, by their own belief, that they are false-priests, hypocrites of heart, wicked people, mostly men, who exploit the priest-hood of decency and purity and even order, that they are base and low, wicked imposters and fools, base and disgusting murderers, with insincere words of fools on their mouths. Now some of these are having Babylonian perversities, to disturb and dessecrate, for they make themselves so by the corruption of the priest-hood, and it enters into perversity against purity and what is good. Now these are not criminals brought out of prison, but the gallows is for them. Now are not many of them rebellious against morality, that they are found with rebellion like witch-craft, and are not some of them having demons, even, that they are even more strange? Now the demons, do they resist them? But are they not those who welcome a demon and nurture it, that it becomes a common thing of the heart for them and their deeds? Now some are even polite, as polite in the false priest-hood, and yet they are making themselves meek and gentle, for they humble themselves in an unacceptable way, that they become meek and perverse, to dessecrate, and to do violence as an unacceptable servant. Now there is not integrity with this gentleness and meekness, and it is a meekness of self-abuse, for they make themselves low by the abandonment of integrity, that it is like humility, but is not so. Now these are not the Nazi priests, and they are very opposite to the Nazi priests, that they are much the exact opposite of them in many ways.
	Now the Nazi priests are family values, morality, and decency in a reasonable fashion, for they are for decency in some things, and they are for the fair shade, believing the fair shade to be good and for goodness, that the goodness of the fair shade is promoted and the desire is to maintain it and allow the fair shade to prosper. For they are not those promoting things of slaves, but things of the goodness of the fair shade.
	Now as for those who are remaining, who are not priests, who are not brought out of the INCEL gang, by the angel, because they are there wrongly by the doctrine of Egypt that considered them offenders, these remaining are those prisoners who are cooks, who are butchers, who are corrupt and as if dreaming in their wickedness and injustice, that they are indeed men, and not really gentle, and they are identified by Joseph, even, and they are for the gallows. Now even Egypt has placed them in prison, and the priest who poured drink, he was there wrongly, and Joseph, too, was there wrongly. Now he is a murderer, this butcher and cook, and is it not right that he is for the gallows? Now is he a priest? But neither are those not priests who also are in the INCEL gang for protection, and Orgoth's lowest shelf, it is Orgoth's servant, and it is the prison of the mountain of Orgoth at the lowest shelf prior to the line of no comprehension, which is lower than the line of reason, which is the Ocean floor, that in the abyss, that is lower than the mountain of Orgoth, for it is the mountain of hell, much is becoming opposite, for it is below the line of comprehension, that the lava is here and the brightness, that it turns substance to molten liquid and there is slander and murder and the slaying for pleasure, that it is below the line of comprehension, and Orgoth's servant is above it, that only those in the lake of fire are lower than him. Now what is at the first shelf, the highest shelf? But it is the slaves who occupy this shelf, being the slaves who are impious towards poverty and misfortune even if it is only temporary, and they are impious and for swallowing up humble things and things of great worth and intelligence, that the slaves of such are with cruel pride and are impious and yet they prey on what is better than them, and many slave owners, even those who are wealthy in money, they have been impious towards, for these slaves who are with cruel pride, to devour, are better than the lowest shelf of Orgoth, the mountain in hell. Now what is at the second shelf, the middle-shelf? But is it not those who are violent, and having violence and murder when it is unjust, that they call it just? For the three shelves are prisons in hell, on the mountain, Orgoth, and the violent are on the second shelf, being murderers who are as violent people, sometimes claiming some measure of justice, and yet they murder like soldiers and they are not soldiers, that they murder, that these are still better than the lowest shelf of Orgoth, being Orgoth's servant, for the lowest shelf is servant and can be part of the two higher shelves at any time. Now the slaves of the highest shelf are in the prison of hell, and are in the prison of slavery upon the Earth, that these are spared, their lives, that they might work as slaves in the field, or in some other place, and  can it not also be true of the violent, who is at the second shelf, that he is sometimes, being killing when it is not justice, occupying the a place of slavery, and yet does this not work in mining and slavery that is hard where there are metal tools and the oversight of officials, for they are not for slave owners who are citizens, for they are violent. Now what use has the lowest shelf, but it is for the gallows after the priests have been brought out of it. Now likewise, Sodom and Egypt must be cast out if there is to be justice.

Two peoples I have identified from the dark shade who are not Sodom and Egypt, and Egypt is not ethnicity, for there are those who I called as a tribe found in nature, among forests, not jungles, and grass, and river, that these are those of integrity, discipline and honour, being a diligent people who have integrity. Now the other, they are righteous, and with morality and integrity. Now neither of these are as Sodom and Egypt that is servant to them both and parasites to them both. Now it is my advice only, that they are needing to be separate from those who are servants to them, and all people are having to be separate from them.

Now to those of faith, when you have fullfilled, does God perform that he is faithful? But Elijah says, if I am enough in the right.

You leave when you are done or stay forever. Valaish. You have reason yet or small nothing. Fiener. Too extreme and only theory. Rel. The bad seed among you wants it. Resh. Nothing in the world is not corrupted by the wicked. Icha. Believers should not be so trusting of the world. Falim.

I have imagined an alternative society that exists within a society and is peaceful, for it is a society that desires to do the right thing and does not scatter where one is at need and none help them which is a way in which Babylon scatters Christians and conquers. Of course many bad causes attack in layers, exploiting the jelousy or hatred towards something before moving to the next thing that is unwanted by the overwhelming attack. If a person is to consider the possibilities of capitalism to be tailored against some groups or the hi-jacking of mid-level government during a crises, than it becomes even more apparent why having an alternative society that desires to do what is right provides stability for any nation that has such a society that is in symbosis with the greater society and yet contained in such a way as to support others who might be dealing with financial problems or some other problems, possibly persecution. Not respecting proper boundaries is a sign that some do not desire for an alliance and co-operation to work, and one can imagine that forcing conflicts in the way they are forced to bring about contention within is one manner in which such a society would be scattered, and another would be the use of capitalism to break up such a society when those part of the society do not support each other.
